# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Managed by Scribe.

### 2026-02-21: Type safety — strict mode non-negotiable
**By:** Edie (carried from beta)
**What:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed.
**Why:** Types are contracts. If it compiles, it works. Strict mode catches entire categories of bugs.

### 2026-02-21: Hook-based governance over prompt instructions
**By:** Baer (carried from beta)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored or overridden. Hooks are code — they execute deterministically.

### 2026-02-21: Node.js >=20, ESM-only, streaming-first
**By:** Fortier (carried from beta)
**What:** Runtime target is Node.js 20+. ESM-only (no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards). Async iterators over buffers.
**Why:** Modern Node.js features enable cleaner async patterns. ESM-only eliminates CJS interop complexity.

### 2026-02-21: Casting — The Usual Suspects, permanent
**By:** Squad Coordinator (carried from beta)
**What:** Team names drawn from The Usual Suspects (1995). Scribe is always Scribe. Ralph is always Ralph. Names persist across repos and replatforms.
**Why:** Names are team identity. The team rebuilt Squad beta with these names.

### 2026-02-21: Proposal-first workflow
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written. Cheaper to change a doc than refactor code.

### 2026-02-21: Tone ceiling — always enforced
**By:** McManus (carried from beta)
**What:** No hype, no hand-waving, no claims without citations. Every public-facing statement must be substantiated.
**Why:** Trust is earned through accuracy, not enthusiasm.

### 2026-02-21: Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved
**By:** Rabin (carried from beta)
**What:** CLI remains thin (`cli.js`), runtime stays modular. Zero runtime dependencies for the CLI scaffolding path.
**Why:** Users should be able to run `npx` without downloading a dependency tree.

### 2026-02-21: Merge driver for append-only files
**By:** Kobayashi (carried from beta)
**What:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`.
**Why:** Enables conflict-free merging of team state across branches. Both sides only append content.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — Interactive Shell as Primary UX
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad becomes its own interactive CLI shell. `squad` with no args enters a REPL where users talk directly to the team. Copilot SDK is the LLM backend.
**Why:** Squad needs to own the full interactive experience with real-time status and direct coordination UX.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — no temp/memory files in repo root
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** NEVER write temp files, issue files, or memory files to the repo root. All squad state/scratch files belong in .squad/ and ONLY .squad/. Root tree of a user's repo is sacred.
**Why:** User request — hard rule. Captured for all agents.

### 2026-02-21: npm workspace protocol for monorepo
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** Use npm-native workspace resolution (version-string references) instead of `workspace:*` protocol for cross-package dependencies.
**Why:** The `workspace:*` protocol is pnpm/Yarn-specific. npm workspaces resolve workspace packages automatically.
**Impact:** All inter-package dependencies in `packages/*/package.json` should use the actual version string, not `workspace:*`.

### 2026-02-21: Distribution moves to npm (supersedes GitHub-native)
**By:** Rabin (Distribution) + Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** Squad packages (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli`) are distributed via npmjs.com. The GitHub-native `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path is deprecated.
**Why:** npm is the standard distribution channel. Root `cli.js` prints deprecation warning when invoked via old path.

### 2026-02-21: Coordinator prompt structure — three routing modes
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**What:** Coordinator uses structured response format: `DIRECT:` (answer inline), `ROUTE:` + `TASK:` + `CONTEXT:` (single agent), `MULTI:` (fan-out). Unrecognized formats fall back to `DIRECT`.
**Why:** Keyword prefixes are cheap to parse and reliable. Fallback-to-direct prevents silent failures.

### 2026-02-21: CLI entry point split — src/index.ts is a pure barrel
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** `src/index.ts` is a pure re-export barrel with ZERO side effects. `src/cli-entry.ts` contains `main()` and all CLI routing.
**Why:** Library consumers importing `@bradygaster/squad` were triggering CLI argument parsing and `process.exit()` on import.

### 2026-02-21: Process.exit() refactor — library-safe CLI functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**What:** `fatal()` throws `SquadError` instead of `process.exit(1)`. Only `cli-entry.ts` may call `process.exit()`.
**Pattern:** Library functions throw `SquadError`. CLI entry catches and exits. Library consumers catch for structured error handling.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — docs as you go
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot)
**What:** Doc and blog as you go during SquadUI integration work. Doesn't have to be perfect — keep docs updated incrementally.

### 2026-02-22: Repository scope directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** This squad works on `bradygaster/squad-pr` ONLY — not `bradygaster/squad`. Until further notice, all issue tracking, PRs, and work target the squad-pr repository. Do NOT change anything in bradygaster/squad repo.

### 2026-02-22: Runtime EventBus as canonical bus
**By:** Fortier
**What:** `runtime/event-bus.ts` (colon-notation: `session:created`, `subscribe()` API) is the canonical EventBus for all orchestration classes. The `client/event-bus.ts` (dot-notation) remains for backward-compat but should not be used in new code.
**Why:** Runtime EventBus has proper error isolation — one handler failure doesn't crash others.

### 2026-02-22: Subpath exports in @bradygaster/squad-sdk
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** SDK declares subpath exports (`.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, and module paths). Each uses types-first condition ordering.
**Constraints:** Every subpath needs a source barrel. `"types"` before `"import"`. ESM-only: no `"require"` condition.

### 2026-02-22: User directive — Aspire testing requirements
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Integration tests must launch the Aspire dashboard and validate OTel telemetry shows up. Use Playwright. Use latest Aspire bits. Reference aspire.dev (NOT learn.microsoft.com). It's "Aspire" not ".NET Aspire".

### 2026-02-23: User directive — code fences
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Never use / or \ as code fences in GitHub issues, PRs, or comments. Only use backticks to format code.

### 2026-02-23: User Directive — Docs Overhaul & Publication Pause
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Pause docs publication until Brady explicitly gives go-ahead. Tone: lighthearted, welcoming, fun (NOT stuffy). First doc should be "first experience" with squad CLI. All docs: brief, prompt-first, action-oriented, fun. Human tone throughout.

### 2026-02-23: Use sendAndWait for streaming dispatch
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** `dispatchToAgent()` and `dispatchToCoordinator()` use `sendAndWait()` instead of `sendMessage()`. Fallback listens for `turn_end`/`idle` if unavailable.
**Why:** `sendMessage()` is fire-and-forget — resolves before streaming deltas arrive.
**Impact:** Never parse `accumulated` after a bare `sendMessage()`. Always use `awaitStreamedResponse`.

### 2026-02-23: extractDelta field priority — deltaContent first
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** `extractDelta` priority: `deltaContent` > `delta` > `content`. Matches SDK actual format.
**Impact:** Use `deltaContent` as the canonical field name for streamed text chunks.

### 2026-02-24: Per-command --help/-h: intercept-before-dispatch pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** All CLI subcommands support `--help` and `-h`. Help intercepted before command routing prevents destructive commands from executing.
**Convention:** New CLI commands MUST have a `getCommandHelp()` entry with usage, description, options, and 2+ examples.

### 2026-02-25: REPL cancellation and configurable timeout
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** Ctrl+C immediately resets `processing` state. Timeout: `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` (seconds) > `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` (ms) > 600000ms default. CLI `--timeout` flag sets env var.

### 2026-02-24: Shell Observability Metrics
**By:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**What:** Four metrics under `squad.shell.*` namespace, gated behind `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`.
**Convention:** Shell metrics require explicit consent via `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`, separate from OTLP endpoint activation.

### 2026-02-23: Telemetry in both CLI and agent modes
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad should pump telemetry during BOTH modes: (1) standalone Squad CLI, and (2) running as an agent inside GitHub Copilot CLI.

### 2026-02-27: ASCII-only separators and NO_COLOR
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**What:** All separators use ASCII hyphens. Text-over-emoji principle: text status is primary, emoji is supplementary.
**Convention:** Use ASCII hyphens for separators. Keep emoji out of status/system messages.

### 2026-02-24: Version format — bare semver canonical
**By:** Fenster
**What:** Bare semver (e.g., `0.8.5.1`) for version commands. Display contexts use `squad v{VERSION}`.

### 2026-02-25: Help text — progressive disclosure
**By:** Fenster
**What:** Default `/help` shows 4 essential lines. `/help full` shows complete reference.

### 2026-02-24: Unified status vocabulary
**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**What:** Use `[WORK]` / `[STREAM]` / `[ERR]` / `[IDLE]` across ALL status surfaces.
**Why:** Most granular, NO_COLOR compatible, text-over-emoji, consistent across contexts.

### 2026-02-24: Pick one tagline
**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**What:** Use "Team of AI agents at your fingertips" everywhere.

### 2026-02-24: User directive — experimental messaging
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** CLI docs should note the project is experimental and ask users to file issues.

### 2026-02-28: User directive — DO NOT merge PR #547
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** DO NOT merge PR #547 (Squad Remote Control). Do not touch #547 at all.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-28: CLI Critical Gap Issues Filed
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** 4 critical CLI gaps filed as GitHub issues #554–#557 for explicit team tracking:
- #554: `--preview` flag undocumented and untested
- #556: `--timeout` flag undocumented and untested
- #557: `upgrade --self` is dead code
- #555: `run` subcommand is a stub (non-functional)

**Why:** Orchestration logs captured gaps but they lacked actionable GitHub tracking and ownership. Filed issues now have explicit assignment to Fenster, clear acceptance criteria, and visibility in Wave E planning.

### 2026-02-28: Test Gap Issues Filed (10 items)
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**What:** 10 moderate CLI/test gaps filed as issues #558–#567:
- #558: Exit code consistency untested
- #559: Timeout edge cases untested
- #560: Missing per-command help
- #561: Shell-specific flag behavior untested
- #562: Env var fallback paths untested
- #563: REPL mode transitions untested
- #564: Config file precedence untested
- #565: Agent spawn flags undocumented
- #566: Untested flag aliases
- #567: Flag parsing error handling untested

**Why:** Each gap identified in coverage analysis but lacked explicit GitHub tracking for prioritization and team visibility.

### 2026-02-28: Documentation Audit Results (10 issues)
**By:** McManus (DevRel)
**What:** Docs audit filed 10 GitHub issues (#568–#575, #577–#578) spanning:
- Feature documentation lag (#568 `squad run`, #570 consult mode, #572 Ralph smart triage)
- Terminology inconsistency (#569 triage/watch/loop naming)
- Brand compliance (#571 experimental banner on 40+ docs)
- Clarity/UX gaps (#573 response modes, #575 dual-root, #577 VS Code, #578 session examples)
- Reference issue (#574 README command count)

**Why:** Features shipped faster than documentation. PR #552, #553 merged without doc updates. No automation to enforce experimental banner. Users discover advanced features accidentally.

**Root cause:** Feature-docs lag, decision-doc drift, no brand enforcement in CI.

### 2026-02-28: Dogfood UX Issues Filed (4 items)
**By:** Waingro (Dogfooder)
**What:** Dogfood testing against 8 realistic scenarios surfaced 4 UX issues (filed as #576, #579–#581):
- #576 (P1): Shell launch fails in non-TTY piped mode (Blocks CI)
- #580 (P1): Help text overwhelms new users (44 lines, no tiering)
- #579 (P2): Status shows parent `.squad/` as local (confusing in multi-project workspaces)
- #581 (P2): Error messages show debug output always (noisy production logs)

**Why:** CLI is solid for happy path but first-time user experience and CI/CD integration have friction points. All 4 block either new user onboarding or automation workflows.

**Priority:** #576 > #580 > #581 > #579. All should be fixed before next public release.

### 2026-02-28: decisions.md Aggressive Cleanup
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Trimmed `decisions.md` from 226KB (223 entries) to 10.3KB (35 entries) — 95% reduction.
- Kept: Core architectural decisions, active process rules, active user directives, current UX conventions, runtime patterns
- Archived: Implementation details, one-time setup, PR reviews, audit reports, wave planning, superseded decisions, duplicates
- Created: `decisions-archive.md` with full original content preserved

**Why:** Context window bloat during release push. Every agent loads 95% less decisions context. Full history preserved append-only.

**Impact:** File size reduced, agent context efficiency improved, all decisions preserved in archive.

### 2026-02-28: Backlog Gap Issues Filed (8 items)
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Approval:** Brady (via directive in issue request)
**What:** Filed 8 missing backlog items from `.squad/identity/now.md` as GitHub issues. These items were identified as "should-fix" polish or "post-M1" improvements but lacked explicit GitHub tracking until now.

**Why:** Brady requested: "Cross-reference the known backlog against filed issues and file anything missing." The team had filed 28 issues this session (#554–#581), but 8 known items from `now.md` remained unfiled. Without GitHub issues, these lack ownership assignment, visibility for Wave E planning, trackability in automated workflows, and routing to squad members.

**Issues Filed:**
- #583 (squad:rabin): Add `homepage` and `bugs` fields to package.json
- #584 (squad:mcmanus): Document alpha→v1.0 breaking change policy in README
- #585 (squad:edie): Add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to tsconfig
- #586 (squad:edie): Tighten ~26 `any` types in SDK
- #587 (squad:mcmanus): Add architecture overview doc
- #588 (squad:kujan): Implement SQUAD_DEBUG env var test
- #589 (squad:kujan): One real Copilot SDK integration test
- #590 (squad:baer): `npm audit fix` for dev-dependency ReDoS warnings
- #591 (squad:hockney, type:bug): Aspire dashboard test fails — docker pull in test suite
- #592 (squad:rabin): Replace workspace:* protocol with version string

**Impact:** Full backlog now visible with explicit issues. No unmapped items. Each issue routed to the squad member domain expert. Issues are independent; can be executed in any order.

### 2026-02-28: Codebase Scan — Unfiled Issues Audit
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Requested by:** Brady
**Date:** 2026-02-28T22:05:00Z
**Status:** Complete — 2 new issues filed

**What:** Systematic scan of the codebase to identify known issues that haven't been filed as GitHub issues. Checked:
1. TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments in code
2. TypeScript strict mode violations (@ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error)
3. Skipped/todo tests (.skip() or .todo())
4. Errant console.log statements
5. Missing package.json metadata fields

**Findings:**
- Type safety violations: ✅ CLEAN — Zero @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error found. Strict mode compliance excellent.
- Workspace protocol: ❌ VIOLATION — 1 issue filed (#592): `workspace:*` in squad-cli violates npm workspace convention
- Skipped tests: ❌ GAP — 1 issue filed (#588): SQUAD_DEBUG test is .todo() placeholder
- Console.log: ✅ INTENTIONAL — All are user-facing output (status, errors)
- TODO comments: ✅ TEMPLATES — TODOs in generated workflow templates, not code
- Package.json: ✅ TRACKED — Missing homepage/bugs already filed as #583

**Code Quality Assessment:**
- Type Safety (Excellent): Zero violations of strict mode or type suppression. Team decision being followed faithfully.
- TODO/FIXME Comments (Clean): All TODOs in upgrade.ts and workflows.ts are template strings for generated GitHub Actions YAML, intentionally scoped.
- Console Output (Intentional): All are user-facing (dashboard startup, OTLP endpoint, issue labeling, shell loading) — no debug debris.
- Dead Code (None Found): No unreachable code, orphaned functions, or unused exports detected.

**Recommendations:**
1. Immediate: Fix workspace protocol violation (#592) — violates established team convention
2. Soon: Implement SQUAD_DEBUG test (#588) — fills observable test gap
3. Going forward: Maintain type discipline; review package.json metadata during SDK/CLI version bumps

**Conclusion:** Codebase in good health. Type safety discipline strong. No hidden technical debt. Conventions mostly followed (one npm workspace exception). Test coverage has minor gaps in observability.
