# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Managed by Scribe.

### 2026-02-21: Type safety — strict mode non-negotiable
**By:** Edie (carried from beta)
**What:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed.
**Why:** Types are contracts. If it compiles, it works. Strict mode catches entire categories of bugs.

### 2026-02-21: Hook-based governance over prompt instructions
**By:** Baer (carried from beta)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored or overridden. Hooks are code — they execute deterministically.

### 2026-02-21: Node.js >=20, ESM-only, streaming-first
**By:** Fortier (carried from beta)
**What:** Runtime target is Node.js 20+. ESM-only (no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards). Async iterators over buffers.
**Why:** Modern Node.js features enable cleaner async patterns. ESM-only eliminates CJS interop complexity.

### 2026-02-21: Casting — The Usual Suspects, permanent
**By:** Squad Coordinator (carried from beta)
**What:** Team names drawn from The Usual Suspects (1995). Scribe is always Scribe. Ralph is always Ralph. Names persist across repos and replatforms.
**Why:** Names are team identity. The team rebuilt Squad beta with these names.

### 2026-02-21: Proposal-first workflow
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written. Cheaper to change a doc than refactor code.

### 2026-02-21: Tone ceiling — always enforced
**By:** McManus (carried from beta)
**What:** No hype, no hand-waving, no claims without citations. Every public-facing statement must be substantiated.
**Why:** Trust is earned through accuracy, not enthusiasm.

### 2026-02-21: Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved
**By:** Rabin (carried from beta)
**What:** CLI remains thin (`cli.js`), runtime stays modular. Zero runtime dependencies for the CLI scaffolding path.
**Why:** Users should be able to run `npx` without downloading a dependency tree.

### 2026-02-21: Merge driver for append-only files
**By:** Kobayashi (carried from beta)
**What:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`.
**Why:** Enables conflict-free merging of team state across branches. Both sides only append content.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — Interactive Shell as Primary UX
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad becomes its own interactive CLI shell. `squad` with no args enters a REPL where users talk directly to the team. Copilot SDK is the LLM backend.
**Why:** Squad needs to own the full interactive experience with real-time status and direct coordination UX.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — no temp/memory files in repo root
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** NEVER write temp files, issue files, or memory files to the repo root. All squad state/scratch files belong in .squad/ and ONLY .squad/. Root tree of a user's repo is sacred.
**Why:** User request — hard rule. Captured for all agents.

### 2026-02-21: npm workspace protocol for monorepo
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** Use npm-native workspace resolution (version-string references) instead of `workspace:*` protocol for cross-package dependencies.
**Why:** The `workspace:*` protocol is pnpm/Yarn-specific. npm workspaces resolve workspace packages automatically.
**Impact:** All inter-package dependencies in `packages/*/package.json` should use the actual version string, not `workspace:*`.

### 2026-02-21: Distribution is npm-only (GitHub-native removed)
**By:** Rabin (Distribution) + Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** Squad packages (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli`) are distributed exclusively via npmjs.com. The GitHub-native `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path has been removed.
**Why:** npm is the standard distribution channel. One distribution path reduces confusion and maintenance burden. Root `cli.js` prints deprecation warning if anyone still hits the old path.

### 2026-02-21: Coordinator prompt structure — three routing modes
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**What:** Coordinator uses structured response format: `DIRECT:` (answer inline), `ROUTE:` + `TASK:` + `CONTEXT:` (single agent), `MULTI:` (fan-out). Unrecognized formats fall back to `DIRECT`.
**Why:** Keyword prefixes are cheap to parse and reliable. Fallback-to-direct prevents silent failures.

### 2026-02-21: CLI entry point split — src/index.ts is a pure barrel
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** `src/index.ts` is a pure re-export barrel with ZERO side effects. `src/cli-entry.ts` contains `main()` and all CLI routing.
**Why:** Library consumers importing `@bradygaster/squad` were triggering CLI argument parsing and `process.exit()` on import.

### 2026-02-21: Process.exit() refactor — library-safe CLI functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**What:** `fatal()` throws `SquadError` instead of `process.exit(1)`. Only `cli-entry.ts` may call `process.exit()`.
**Pattern:** Library functions throw `SquadError`. CLI entry catches and exits. Library consumers catch for structured error handling.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — docs as you go
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot)
**What:** Doc and blog as you go during SquadUI integration work. Doesn't have to be perfect — keep docs updated incrementally.

### 2026-02-22: Runtime EventBus as canonical bus
**By:** Fortier
**What:** `runtime/event-bus.ts` (colon-notation: `session:created`, `subscribe()` API) is the canonical EventBus for all orchestration classes. The `client/event-bus.ts` (dot-notation) remains for backward-compat but should not be used in new code.
**Why:** Runtime EventBus has proper error isolation — one handler failure doesn't crash others.

### 2026-02-22: Subpath exports in @bradygaster/squad-sdk
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**What:** SDK declares subpath exports (`.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, and module paths). Each uses types-first condition ordering.
**Constraints:** Every subpath needs a source barrel. `"types"` before `"import"`. ESM-only: no `"require"` condition.

### 2026-02-22: User directive — Aspire testing requirements
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Integration tests must launch the Aspire dashboard and validate OTel telemetry shows up. Use Playwright. Use latest Aspire bits. Reference aspire.dev (NOT learn.microsoft.com). It's "Aspire" not ".NET Aspire".

### 2026-02-23: User directive — code fences
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Never use / or \ as code fences in GitHub issues, PRs, or comments. Only use backticks to format code.

### 2026-02-23: User Directive — Docs Overhaul & Publication Pause
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Pause docs publication until Brady explicitly gives go-ahead. Tone: lighthearted, welcoming, fun (NOT stuffy). First doc should be "first experience" with squad CLI. All docs: brief, prompt-first, action-oriented, fun. Human tone throughout.

### 2026-02-23: Use sendAndWait for streaming dispatch
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** `dispatchToAgent()` and `dispatchToCoordinator()` use `sendAndWait()` instead of `sendMessage()`. Fallback listens for `turn_end`/`idle` if unavailable.
**Why:** `sendMessage()` is fire-and-forget — resolves before streaming deltas arrive.
**Impact:** Never parse `accumulated` after a bare `sendMessage()`. Always use `awaitStreamedResponse`.

### 2026-02-23: extractDelta field priority — deltaContent first
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** `extractDelta` priority: `deltaContent` > `delta` > `content`. Matches SDK actual format.
**Impact:** Use `deltaContent` as the canonical field name for streamed text chunks.

### 2026-02-24: Per-command --help/-h: intercept-before-dispatch pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** All CLI subcommands support `--help` and `-h`. Help intercepted before command routing prevents destructive commands from executing.
**Convention:** New CLI commands MUST have a `getCommandHelp()` entry with usage, description, options, and 2+ examples.

### 2026-02-25: REPL cancellation and configurable timeout
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**What:** Ctrl+C immediately resets `processing` state. Timeout: `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` (seconds) > `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` (ms) > 600000ms default. CLI `--timeout` flag sets env var.

### 2026-02-24: Shell Observability Metrics
**By:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**What:** Four metrics under `squad.shell.*` namespace, gated behind `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`.
**Convention:** Shell metrics require explicit consent via `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`, separate from OTLP endpoint activation.

### 2026-02-23: Telemetry in both CLI and agent modes
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad should pump telemetry during BOTH modes: (1) standalone Squad CLI, and (2) running as an agent inside GitHub Copilot CLI.

### 2026-02-27: ASCII-only separators and NO_COLOR
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**What:** All separators use ASCII hyphens. Text-over-emoji principle: text status is primary, emoji is supplementary.
**Convention:** Use ASCII hyphens for separators. Keep emoji out of status/system messages.

### 2026-02-24: Version format — bare semver canonical
**By:** Fenster
**What:** Bare semver (e.g., `0.8.5.1`) for version commands. Display contexts use `squad v{VERSION}`.

### 2026-02-25: Help text — progressive disclosure
**By:** Fenster
**What:** Default `/help` shows 4 essential lines. `/help full` shows complete reference.

### 2026-02-24: Unified status vocabulary
**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**What:** Use `[WORK]` / `[STREAM]` / `[ERR]` / `[IDLE]` across ALL status surfaces.
**Why:** Most granular, NO_COLOR compatible, text-over-emoji, consistent across contexts.

### 2026-02-24: Pick one tagline
**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**What:** Use "Team of AI agents at your fingertips" everywhere.

### 2026-02-24: User directive — experimental messaging
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** CLI docs should note the project is experimental and ask users to file issues.

### 2026-02-28: User directive — DO NOT merge PR #547
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** DO NOT merge PR #547 (Squad Remote Control). Do not touch #547 at all.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-28: CLI Critical Gap Issues Filed
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** 4 critical CLI gaps filed as GitHub issues #554–#557 for explicit team tracking:
- #554: `--preview` flag undocumented and untested
- #556: `--timeout` flag undocumented and untested
- #557: `upgrade --self` is dead code
- #555: `run` subcommand is a stub (non-functional)

**Why:** Orchestration logs captured gaps but they lacked actionable GitHub tracking and ownership. Filed issues now have explicit assignment to Fenster, clear acceptance criteria, and visibility in Wave E planning.

### 2026-02-28: Test Gap Issues Filed (10 items)
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**What:** 10 moderate CLI/test gaps filed as issues #558–#567:
- #558: Exit code consistency untested
- #559: Timeout edge cases untested
- #560: Missing per-command help
- #561: Shell-specific flag behavior untested
- #562: Env var fallback paths untested
- #563: REPL mode transitions untested
- #564: Config file precedence untested
- #565: Agent spawn flags undocumented
- #566: Untested flag aliases
- #567: Flag parsing error handling untested

**Why:** Each gap identified in coverage analysis but lacked explicit GitHub tracking for prioritization and team visibility.

### 2026-02-28: Documentation Audit Results (10 issues)
**By:** McManus (DevRel)
**What:** Docs audit filed 10 GitHub issues (#568–#575, #577–#578) spanning:
- Feature documentation lag (#568 `squad run`, #570 consult mode, #572 Ralph smart triage)
- Terminology inconsistency (#569 triage/watch/loop naming)
- Brand compliance (#571 experimental banner on 40+ docs)
- Clarity/UX gaps (#573 response modes, #575 dual-root, #577 VS Code, #578 session examples)
- Reference issue (#574 README command count)

**Why:** Features shipped faster than documentation. PR #552, #553 merged without doc updates. No automation to enforce experimental banner. Users discover advanced features accidentally.

**Root cause:** Feature-docs lag, decision-doc drift, no brand enforcement in CI.

### 2026-02-28: Dogfood UX Issues Filed (4 items)
**By:** Waingro (Dogfooder)
**What:** Dogfood testing against 8 realistic scenarios surfaced 4 UX issues (filed as #576, #579–#581):
- #576 (P1): Shell launch fails in non-TTY piped mode (Blocks CI)
- #580 (P1): Help text overwhelms new users (44 lines, no tiering)
- #579 (P2): Status shows parent `.squad/` as local (confusing in multi-project workspaces)
- #581 (P2): Error messages show debug output always (noisy production logs)

**Why:** CLI is solid for happy path but first-time user experience and CI/CD integration have friction points. All 4 block either new user onboarding or automation workflows.

**Priority:** #576 > #580 > #581 > #579. All should be fixed before next public release.

### 2026-02-28: decisions.md Aggressive Cleanup
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Trimmed `decisions.md` from 226KB (223 entries) to 10.3KB (35 entries) — 95% reduction.
- Kept: Core architectural decisions, active process rules, active user directives, current UX conventions, runtime patterns
- Archived: Implementation details, one-time setup, PR reviews, audit reports, wave planning, superseded decisions, duplicates
- Created: `decisions-archive.md` with full original content preserved

**Why:** Context window bloat during release push. Every agent loads 95% less decisions context. Full history preserved append-only.

**Impact:** File size reduced, agent context efficiency improved, all decisions preserved in archive.

### 2026-02-28: Backlog Gap Issues Filed (8 items)
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Approval:** Brady (via directive in issue request)
**What:** Filed 8 missing backlog items from `.squad/identity/now.md` as GitHub issues. These items were identified as "should-fix" polish or "post-M1" improvements but lacked explicit GitHub tracking until now.

**Why:** Brady requested: "Cross-reference the known backlog against filed issues and file anything missing." The team had filed 28 issues this session (#554–#581), but 8 known items from `now.md` remained unfiled. Without GitHub issues, these lack ownership assignment, visibility for Wave E planning, trackability in automated workflows, and routing to squad members.

**Issues Filed:**
- #583 (squad:rabin): Add `homepage` and `bugs` fields to package.json
- #584 (squad:mcmanus): Document alpha→v1.0 breaking change policy in README
- #585 (squad:edie): Add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to tsconfig
- #586 (squad:edie): Tighten ~26 `any` types in SDK
- #587 (squad:mcmanus): Add architecture overview doc
- #588 (squad:kujan): Implement SQUAD_DEBUG env var test
- #589 (squad:kujan): One real Copilot SDK integration test
- #590 (squad:baer): `npm audit fix` for dev-dependency ReDoS warnings
- #591 (squad:hockney, type:bug): Aspire dashboard test fails — docker pull in test suite
- #592 (squad:rabin): Replace workspace:* protocol with version string

**Impact:** Full backlog now visible with explicit issues. No unmapped items. Each issue routed to the squad member domain expert. Issues are independent; can be executed in any order.

### 2026-02-28: Codebase Scan — Unfiled Issues Audit
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Requested by:** Brady
**Date:** 2026-02-28T22:05:00Z
**Status:** Complete — 2 new issues filed

**What:** Systematic scan of the codebase to identify known issues that haven't been filed as GitHub issues. Checked:
1. TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments in code
2. TypeScript strict mode violations (@ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error)
3. Skipped/todo tests (.skip() or .todo())
4. Errant console.log statements
5. Missing package.json metadata fields

**Findings:**
- Type safety violations: ✅ CLEAN — Zero @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error found. Strict mode compliance excellent.
- Workspace protocol: ❌ VIOLATION — 1 issue filed (#592): `workspace:*` in squad-cli violates npm workspace convention
- Skipped tests: ❌ GAP — 1 issue filed (#588): SQUAD_DEBUG test is .todo() placeholder
- Console.log: ✅ INTENTIONAL — All are user-facing output (status, errors)
- TODO comments: ✅ TEMPLATES — TODOs in generated workflow templates, not code
- Package.json: ✅ TRACKED — Missing homepage/bugs already filed as #583

**Code Quality Assessment:**
- Type Safety (Excellent): Zero violations of strict mode or type suppression. Team decision being followed faithfully.
- TODO/FIXME Comments (Clean): All TODOs in upgrade.ts and workflows.ts are template strings for generated GitHub Actions YAML, intentionally scoped.
- Console Output (Intentional): All are user-facing (dashboard startup, OTLP endpoint, issue labeling, shell loading) — no debug debris.
- Dead Code (None Found): No unreachable code, orphaned functions, or unused exports detected.

**Recommendations:**
1. Immediate: Fix workspace protocol violation (#592) — violates established team convention
2. Soon: Implement SQUAD_DEBUG test (#588) — fills observable test gap
3. Going forward: Maintain type discipline; review package.json metadata during SDK/CLI version bumps

**Conclusion:** Codebase in good health. Type safety discipline strong. No hidden technical debt. Conventions mostly followed (one npm workspace exception). Test coverage has minor gaps in observability.

### 2026-02-28: Auto-link detection for preview builds
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**What:** When running from source (`VERSION` contains `-preview`), the CLI checks if `@bradygaster/squad-cli` is globally npm-linked. If not, it prompts the developer to link it. Declining creates `~/.squad/.no-auto-link` to suppress future prompts.
**Why:** Dev convenience — saves contributors from forgetting `npm link` after cloning. Non-interactive commands (help, version, export, import, doctor, scrub-emails) skip the check. Everything is wrapped in try/catch so failures are silent.
**Impact:** Only affects `-preview` builds in interactive TTY sessions. No effect on published releases or CI.

### 2026-03-01T00:34Z: User directive — Full scrollback support in REPL shell
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The REPL shell must support full scrollback — users should be able to scroll up and down to see all text (paste, run output, rendered content, logs) over time, like GitHub Copilot CLI does. The current Ink-based rendering loses/hides content and that's unacceptable.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. This is a P0 UX requirement for the shell.
**Status:** P0 blocking issue. Requires rendering architecture review (Cheritto, Kovash, Marquez).

### 2026-03-01T04:47Z: User directive — Auto-incrementing build numbers
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Add auto-incrementing build numbers to versions. Format: `0.8.6.{N}-preview` where N increments each local build. Tracks build-to-release cadence.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory.

### 2026-03-01: Nap engine — dual sync/async export pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** The nap engine (`cli/core/nap.ts`) exports both `runNap` (async, for CLI entry) and `runNapSync` (sync, for REPL). All internal operations use sync fs calls. The async wrapper exists for CLI convention consistency.
**Why:** REPL `executeCommand` is synchronous and cannot await. ESM forbids `require()`. Exporting a sync variant keeps the REPL integration clean without changing the shell architecture.
**Impact:** Future commands that need both CLI and REPL support should follow this pattern if they only do sync fs work.

### 2026-03-01: First-run gating test strategy
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #607
**What:** Created `test/first-run-gating.test.ts` with 25 tests covering 6 categories of Init Mode gating. Tests use logic-level extraction from App.tsx conditionals, filesystem marker lifecycle via `loadWelcomeData`, and source-code structural assertions for render ordering. No full App component rendering — SDK dependencies make that impractical for unit tests.
**Why:** 3059 tests existed with zero enforcement of first-run gating behavior. The `.first-run` marker, banner uniqueness, assembled-message gating, warning suppression, session-scoped keys, and terminal clear ordering were all untested paths that could regress silently.
**Impact:** All squad members: if you modify `loadWelcomeData`, the `firstRunElement` conditional in App.tsx, or the terminal clear sequence in `runShell`, these tests will catch regressions. The warning suppression tests replicate the `cli-entry.ts` pattern — if that pattern changes, update both locations.

### Verbal's Analysis: "nap" Skill — Context Window Optimization
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**Requested by:** Brady
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Scope:** Approved. Build it. Current context budget analysis:
- Agent spawn loads charter (~500t) + history + decisions.md (4,852t) + team.md (972t)
- Hockney: 25,940t history (worst offender)
- Fenster: 22,574t (history + CLI inventory)
- Coherence cliff: 40-50K tokens on non-task context

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Decision distillation:** Keep decisions.md as single source of truth (don't embed in charters — creates staleness/duplication)
2. **History compression — 12KB rule insufficient:** Six agents blow past threshold. Target **4KB ceiling per history** (~1,000t) with assertions not stories.
3. **Nap should optimize:** Deduplication (strip decisions.md content echoed in histories), staleness (flag closed PRs, merged work), charter bloat (stay <600t), skill pruning (archive high-confidence, no-recent-invocation skills), demand-loading for extra files (CLI inventory, UX catalog, fragility catalog).
4. **Enforcement:** Nap runs periodically or on-demand, enforces hard ceilings without silent quality degradation.

### ShellApi.clearMessages() for terminal state reset
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** `ShellApi` now exposes `clearMessages()` which resets both `messages` and `archivedMessages` React state. Used in session restore and `/clear` command.
**Why:** Without clearing archived messages, old content bleeds through when restoring sessions or clearing the shell. The `/clear` command previously only reset `messages`, leaving `archivedMessages` in the Static render list.
**Impact:** Any code calling `shellApi` to reset shell state should use `clearMessages()` rather than manually manipulating message arrays.

### 2026-03-01: Prompt placeholder hints must not duplicate header banner
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #606
**What:** The InputPrompt placeholder text must provide *complementary* guidance, never repeat what the header banner already shows. The header banner is the single source of truth for @agent routing and /help discovery. Placeholder hints should surface lesser-known features (tab completion, history navigation, utility commands).
**Why:** Two elements showing "Type @agent or /help" simultaneously creates visual noise and a confusing UX. One consistent prompt style throughout the session.
**Impact:** `getHintText()` in InputPrompt.tsx now has two tiers instead of three. Any future prompt hints should check the header banner first to avoid duplication.

### 2026-03-02: Paste detection via debounce in InputPrompt
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**What:** InputPrompt uses a 10ms debounce on `key.return` to distinguish paste from intentional Enter. If more input arrives within 10ms → paste detected → newline preserved. If timer fires without input → real Enter → submit. A `valueRef` (React ref) mirrors mutations synchronously since closure-captured `value` is stale during rapid `useInput` calls. In disabled state, `key.return` appends `\n` to buffer instead of being ignored.
**Why:** Multi-line paste was garbled because `useInput` fires per-character and `key.return` triggered immediate submission.
**Impact:** 10ms delay on single-line submit is imperceptible. UX: multi-line paste preserved. Testing: Hockney should verify paste scenarios use `jest.useFakeTimers()` or equivalent. Future: if Ink adds native bracketed-paste support, debounce can be replaced.

### 2026-03-01: First-run init messaging — single source of truth
**By:** Kovash (REPL & Interactive Shell)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #625
**What:** When no roster exists, only the header banner tells the user about `squad init` / `/init`. The `firstRunElement` block returns `null` for the empty-roster case instead of showing a duplicate message. `firstRunElement` is reserved for the "Your squad is assembled" onboarding when a roster already exists.
**Why:** Two competing UI elements both said "run squad init" — visual noise that confuses the information hierarchy. Banner is persistent and visible; it owns the no-roster guidance. `firstRunElement` owns the roster-present first-run experience.
**Impact:** App.tsx only. No API or prop changes. Banner text reworded to prioritize `/init` (in-shell path) over exit-and-run.

### 2026-03-01: NODE_NO_WARNINGS for subprocess warning suppression
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #624
**What:** `process.env.NODE_NO_WARNINGS = '1'` is set as the first executable line in `cli-entry.ts` (line 2, after shebang). This supplements the existing `process.emitWarning` override.
**Why:** The Copilot SDK spawns child processes that inherit environment variables but NOT in-process monkey-patches like `process.emitWarning` overrides. `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1` is the Node.js-native mechanism for suppressing warnings across an entire process tree. Without it, `ExperimentalWarning` messages (e.g., SQLite) leak into the terminal via the SDK's subprocess stderr forwarding.
**Pattern:** When suppressing Node.js warnings, use BOTH: (1) `process.env.NODE_NO_WARNINGS = '1'` — covers child processes (env var inheritance); (2) `process.emitWarning` override — covers main process (belt-and-suspenders).
**Impact:** Eliminates `ExperimentalWarning` noise in terminal for all Squad CLI users, including when the Copilot SDK spawns subprocesses.

### 2026-03-01: No content suppression based on terminal width
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** Terminal width tiers (compact ≤60, standard, wide ≥100) may adjust *layout* (e.g., wrapping, column arrangement) but must NOT suppress or truncate *content*. Every piece of information shown at 120 columns must also be shown at 40 columns.
**Why:** Users can scroll. Hiding roster names, spacing, help text, or routing hints on narrow terminals removes information the user needs. Layout adapts to width; content does not.
**Convention:** `compact` variable may be used for layout decisions (flex direction, column vs. row) but must NOT gate visibility of text, spacing, or UI sections. `wide` may add supplementary content but narrow must not remove it.

### 2026-03-01: Multi-line user message rendering pattern
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** Multi-line user messages in the Static scrollback use `split('\n')` with a column layout: first line gets the `❯` prefix, subsequent lines get `paddingLeft={2}` for alignment.
**Why:** Ink's horizontal `<Box>` layout doesn't handle embedded `\n` in `<Text>` children predictably when siblings exist. Explicit line splitting with column flex direction gives deterministic multi-line rendering.
**Impact:** Any future changes to user message prefix width must update the `paddingLeft={2}` on continuation lines to match.

### 2026-03-01: Elapsed time display — inline after message content
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Issue:** #605
**What:** Elapsed time annotations on completed agent messages are always rendered inline after the message content as `(X.Xs)` in dimColor. This applies to the Static scrollback block in App.tsx, which is the canonical render path for all completed messages.
**Why:** After the Static scrollback refactor, MessageStream receives `messages=[]` and only renders live streaming content. The duration code in MessageStream was dead. Moving duration display into the Static block ensures it always appears consistently.
**Convention:** `formatDuration()` from MessageStream.tsx is the shared formatter. Format is `Xms` for <1s, `X.Xs` for ≥1s. Always inline, always dimColor, always after content text.

### 2026-03-01: Banner usage line separator convention
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**What:** Banner hint/usage lines use middle dot `·` as inline separator. Init messages use single CTA (no dual-path instructions).
**Why:** Consistent visual rhythm. Middle dot is lighter than em-dash or hyphen for inline command lists. Single CTA reduces cognitive load for new users.
**Impact:** App.tsx headerElement. Future banner copy should follow same separator and single-CTA pattern.

### 2026-03-02: REPL casting engine design
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Status:** Implemented
**Issue:** #638
**What:** Created `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/cast.ts` as a self-contained casting engine with four exports:
1. `parseCastResponse()` — parses the `INIT_TEAM:` format from coordinator output
2. `createTeam()` — scaffolds all `.squad/agents/` directories, writes charters, updates team.md and routing.md, writes casting state JSON
3. `roleToEmoji()` — maps role strings to emoji, reusable across the CLI
4. `formatCastSummary()` — renders a padded roster summary for terminal display

Scribe and Ralph are always injected if missing from the proposal. Casting state is written to `.squad/casting/` (registry.json, history.json, policy.json).
**Why:** Enables coordinator to propose and create teams from within the REPL session after `squad init`.
**Implications:**

### 2026-03-02: Beta → Origin Migration: Version Path (v0.5.4 → v0.8.17)

**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02  
**Context:** Analyzed migration from beta repo (`bradygaster/squad`, v0.5.4) to origin repo (`bradygaster/squad-pr`, v0.8.18-preview). Version gap spans 0.6.x, 0.7.x, 0.8.0–0.8.16 (internal origin development only).

**What:** Beta will jump directly from v0.5.4 to v0.8.17 (skip all intermediate versions). Rationale:
1. **Semantic versioning allows gaps** — version numbers are labels, not counters
2. **Users care about features, not numbers** — comprehensive changelog is more valuable than version sequence
3. **Simplicity reduces risk** — single migration release is easier to execute and communicate
4. **Precedent exists** — major refactors/rewrites commonly skip versions (Angular 2→4, etc)

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: Version jump confuses users. Mitigation: Clear release notes explaining the gap + comprehensive changelog
- Risk: Intermediate versions were never public (no user expectations). Mitigation: This is actually a benefit — no backfill needed

**Impact:** After merge, beta repo version jumps from v0.5.4 to v0.8.17. All intermediate work is included in the 0.8.17 release. Next release after v0.8.17 may be v0.8.18 or v0.9.0 (team decision post-merge).

**Why:** Avoids maintenance burden of backfilling 12+ fake versions. Users get complete feature set in one migration release.

### 2026-03-02: Beta → Origin Migration: Package Naming

**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02

**What:** Deprecate `@bradygaster/create-squad` (beta's package name). All future releases use:
- `@bradygaster/squad-cli` (user-facing CLI)
- `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` (programmatic SDK for integrations)

**Why:** Origin's naming is more accurate and supports independent versioning if needed. Monorepo structure benefits from clear package separation.

**Action:** When v0.8.17 is ready to publish, release a final version of `@bradygaster/create-squad` with deprecation notice: "This package has been renamed to @bradygaster/squad-cli. Install with: npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli"

**Impact:** Package ecosystem clarity. No breaking change for users upgrading (CLI handles detection and warnings).

### 2026-03-02: Beta → Origin Migration: Retroactive v0.8.17 Tag

**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02

**What:** Retroactively tag commit `5b57476` ("chore(release): prep v0.8.16 for npm publish") as v0.8.17. This commit and v0.8.16 have identical code.

**Rationale:**
- Commit `6fdf9d5` jumped directly to v0.8.17-preview (no v0.8.17 release tag exists)
- Commit `87e4f1c` bumps to v0.8.18-preview "after 0.8.17 release" (implying v0.8.17 was released)
- Retroactive tagging is less disruptive than creating a new prep commit and rebasing

**Action:** When banana gate clears, tag origin commit `5b57476` as v0.8.17.

**Why:** Completes the missing link in origin's tag history. Indicates to users which commit was released as v0.8.17.

### 2026-03-02: npx Distribution Migration: Error-Only Shim Strategy

**By:** Rabin (Distribution)  
**Date:** 2026-03-02  
**Context:** Beta repo currently uses GitHub-native distribution (`npx github:bradygaster/squad`). Origin uses npm distribution (`npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli`). After merge, old path will break.

**Problem:** After migration, `npx github:bradygaster/squad` fails (root `package.json` has no `bin` entry). Users hitting the old path get cryptic npm error.

**Solution — Option 5 (Error-only shim):**
1. Add root `bin` entry pointing to `cli.js`
2. `cli.js` detects GitHub-native invocation and prints **bold, clear error** with migration instructions
3. Exit with code 1 (fail fast, no hidden redirection)

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "bin": {
    "squad": "./cli.js"
  }
}
```

Update `cli.js` to print error message with new install instructions:
```
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear, actionable error message (not cryptic npm error)
- ✅ Aligns with npm-only team decision (no perpetuation of GitHub-native path)
- ✅ Low maintenance burden (simple error script, no complex shim)
- ✅ Can be removed in v1.0.0 when beta users have migrated

**Cons:**
- Immediate breakage (no grace period) — but users get clear guidance

**Why This Over Others:**
- Option 1 (keep working) contradicts npm-only decision
- Option 2 (exit early) same as this, but explicit error format needed
- Option 3 (time-limited) best UX but maintenance burden
- Option 4 (just break) user-hostile without error message
- **Option 5 balances user experience + team decision**

**Related Decision:** See 2026-02-21 decision "Distribution is npm-only (GitHub-native removed)"

**User Impact:**
- Users running `npx github:bradygaster/squad` see bold error with `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` instruction
- Existing projects running `squad upgrade` work seamlessly (upgrade logic built-in)
- No data loss or silent breakage

**Upgrade Path (existing beta users):**
```bash
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli
cd /path/to/project
squad upgrade
squad upgrade --migrate-directory  # Optional: .ai-team/ → .squad/
```

**Why:** Rabin's principle: "If users have to think about installation, install is broken." A clear error message respects users better than a cryptic npm error.

### 2026-02-28: Init flow reliability — proposal-first before code

**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**What:** Init/onboarding fixes require a proposal review before implementation. Proposal at `docs/proposals/reliable-init-flow.md`. Two confirmed bugs (race condition in auto-cast, Ctrl+C doesn't abort init session) plus UX gaps (empty-roster messaging, `/init` no-op). P0 bugs are surgical — don't expand scope.
**Why:** Four PRs (#637–#640) patched init iteratively without a unified design. Before writing more patches, the team needs to agree on the golden path. Proposal-first (per team decision 2026-02-21).
**Impact:** Blocks init-related code changes until Brady reviews the proposal.
- Kovash (REPL): Can call `parseCastResponse` + `createTeam` to wire up casting flow in shell dispatcher
- Verbal (Prompts): INIT_TEAM format is now the contract — coordinator prompt should emit this
- Hockney (Tests): cast.ts needs unit tests for parser edge cases, emoji mapping, file creation

### 2026-03-02: REPL empty-roster gate — dual check pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**What:** REPL dispatch is now gated on *populated* roster, not just team.md existence. `hasRosterEntries()` in `coordinator.ts` checks for table data rows in the `## Members` section. Two layers: `handleDispatch` blocks with user guidance, `buildCoordinatorPrompt` injects refusal prompt.
**Why:** After `squad init`, team.md exists but is empty. Coordinator received a "route to agents" prompt with no agents listed, causing silent generic AI behavior. Users never got told to cast their team.
**Convention:** Post-init message references "Copilot session" (works in VS Code, github.com, and Copilot CLI). The `/init` slash command provides same guidance inside REPL.
**Impact:** All agents — if you modify the `## Members` table format in team.md templates, update `hasRosterEntries()` to match.

### 2026-03-02: Connection promise dedup in SquadClient
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**What:** `SquadClient.connect()` now uses a promise dedup pattern — concurrent callers share the same in-flight `connectPromise` instead of throwing "Connection already in progress".
**Why:** Eager warm-up and auto-cast both call `createSession()` → `connect()` at REPL startup, racing on the connection. The throw crashed auto-cast every time.
**Impact:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/adapter/client.ts` only. No API surface change.

### 2026-03-01: CLI UI Polish PRD — Alpha Shipment Over Perfection
**By:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** Team image review identified 20+ UX issues ranging from P0 blockers to P3 future polish

**What:** CLI UI polish follows pragmatic alpha shipment strategy: fix P0 blockers + P1 quick wins, defer grand redesign to post-alpha. 20 discrete issues created with clear priority tiers (P0/P1/P2/P3).

**Why:** Brady confirmed "alpha-level shipment acceptable — no grand redesign today." Team converged on 3 P0 blockers (blank screens, static spinner, missing alpha banner) that would embarrass us vs. 15+ polish items that can iterate post-ship.

**Trade-off:** Shipping with known layout quirks (input positioning, responsive tables) rather than blocking on 1-2 week TUI refactor. Users expect alpha rough edges IF we warn them upfront.

**Priority Rationale:**
- **P0 (must fix):** User-facing broken states — blank screens, no feedback, looks crashed
- **P1 (quick wins):** Accessibility (contrast), usability (copy clarity), visual hierarchy — high ROI, low effort
- **P2 (next sprint):** Layout architecture, responsive design — important but alpha-acceptable if missing
- **P3 (future):** Fixed bottom input, alt screen buffer, creative spinner — delightful but not blockers

**Architectural Implications:**
1. **Quick win discovered:** App.tsx overrides ThinkingIndicator's native rotation with static hints (~5 line fix)
2. **Debt acknowledged:** 3 separate separator implementations need consolidation (P2 work)
3. **Layout strategy:** Ink's layout model fights bottom-anchored input. Alt screen buffer is the real solution (P3 deferred).
4. **Issue granularity:** 20 discrete issues vs. 1 monolithic "fix UI" epic — enables parallel work by Cheritto (11 issues), Kovash (4), Redfoot (2), Fenster (1), Marquez (1 review)

**Success Gate:** "Brady says it doesn't embarrass us" — qualitative gate appropriate for alpha software. Quantitative gates: zero blank screens >500ms, contrast ≥4.5:1, spinner rotates every 3s.

**Impact:**
- **Team routing:** Clear ownership — Cheritto (TUI), Kovash (shell), Redfoot (design), Marquez (UX review)
- **Timeline transparency:** P0 (1-2 days) → P1 (2-3 days) → P2 (1 week) — alpha ship when P0+P1 done
- **Expectation management:** Out of Scope section explicitly lists grand redesign, advanced features, WCAG audit — prevents scope creep

### 2026-03-01: Cast confirmation required for freeform REPL casts
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** P2 from Keaton's reliable-init-flow proposal

**What:** When a user types a freeform message in the REPL and the roster is empty, the cast proposal is shown and the user must confirm (y/yes) before team files are created. Auto-cast from .init-prompt and /init "prompt" skip confirmation since the user explicitly provided the prompt.

**Why:** Prevents garbage casts from vague or accidental first messages (e.g., "hello", "what can you do?"). Matches the squad.agent.md Init Mode pattern where confirmation is required before creating team files.

**Pattern:** pendingCastConfirmation state in shell/index.ts. handleDispatch intercepts y/n at the top before normal routing. inalizeCast() is the shared helper for both auto-confirmed and user-confirmed paths.

### 2026-03-01: Expose setProcessing on ShellApi
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** Init auto-cast path bypassed App.tsx handleSubmit, so processing state was never set — spinner invisible during team casting.

**What:** ShellApi now exposes setProcessing(processing: boolean) so that any code path in index.ts that triggers async work outside of handleSubmit can properly bracket it with processing state. This enables ThinkingIndicator and InputPrompt spinner without duplicating React state management.

**Rule:** Any new async dispatch path in index.ts that bypasses handleSubmit **must** call shellApi.setProcessing(true) before the async work and shellApi.setProcessing(false) in a inally block covering all exit paths.

**Files Changed:**
- packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/components/App.tsx — added setProcessing to ShellApi interface + wired in onReady
- packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/index.ts — added setProcessing calls in handleInitCast (entry, pendingCastConfirmation return, finally block)

### 2026-03-01T20:13:16Z: User directives — UI polish and shipping priorities
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01

**What:**
1. Text box preference: bottom-aligned, squared off (like Copilot CLI / Claude CLI) — future work, not today
2. Alpha-level shipment acceptable for now — no grand UI redesign today
3. CLI must show "experimental, please file issues" banner
4. Spinner/wait messages should rotate every ~3 seconds — use codebase facts, project trivia, vulnerability info, or creative "-ing" words. Never just spin silently.
5. Use wait time to inform or entertain users

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory and crash recovery

### 2026-03-01T20:16:00Z: User directive — CLI timeout too low
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01

**What:** The CLI timeout is set too low — Brady tried using Squad CLI in this repo and it didn't work well. Timeout needs to be increased. Not urgent but should be captured as a CLI improvement opportunity.

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory and PRD inclusion

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad Storage & Resolution Design
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** 
- New directory structure: ~/.config/squad/squads/{name}/.squad/ with ~/.config/squad/config.json for registry
- Keep 
esolveGlobalSquadPath() unchanged; add 
esolveNamedSquadPath(name?: string) and listPersonalSquads() on top
- Auto-migration: existing single personal squad moves to squads/default/ on first run
- Resolution priority: explicit (CLI flag) > project config > env var > git remote mapping > path mapping > default
- Global config.json schema: { version, defaultSquad, squads, mappings }

**Why:** 
- squads/ container avoids collisions with existing files at global root
- Backward-compatible: legacy layout detected and auto-migrated; existing code continues to work
- Clean separation: global config lives alongside squads, not inside any one squad
- Resolution chain enables flexible mapping without breaking existing workflows

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad SDK Functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**What:**
- New SDK exports: 
esolveNamedSquadPath(), listSquads(), createSquad(), deleteSquad(), switchSquad(), 
esolveSquadForProject()
- New type: SquadEntry { name, path, isDefault, createdAt }
- squads.json registry (separate file, not config.json) with squad metadata and mappings
- SquadDirConfig v2 addition: optional personalSquad?: string field (v1 configs unaffected)
- Consult mode updated: setupConsultMode(options?: { squad?: string }) with explicit selection or auto-resolution

**Why:**
- Lazy migration with fallback chain ensures zero breaking changes to existing users
- Separate squads.json is single source of truth for routing; keeps project config focused
- Version handling allows incremental adoption; v1 configs work unchanged
- SDK resolution functions can be called from CLI and library code without duplication

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad CLI Commands & REPL
**By:** Kovash (REPL)
**What:**
- New commands: squad list, squad create <name>, squad switch <name>, squad delete <name>
- Modified commands: squad consult --squad=<name>, squad extract --squad=<name>, squad init --global --name=<name>
- Interactive picker for squad selection: arrow keys (↑/↓), Enter to confirm, Ctrl+C to cancel
- REPL integration: /squad and /squads slash commands with 	riggerSquadReload signal
- .active file stores current active squad name (plain text)
- Status command enhanced to show active squad and squad list

**Why:**
- Picker only shows when needed (multiple squads) and TTY available; non-TTY gracefully uses active squad
- Slash commands follow existing pattern (/init, /agents, etc.); seamless REPL integration
- .active file is simple and atomic; suitable for concurrent CLI access
- Squad deletion safety: cannot delete active squad; requires confirmation

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad UX & Interaction Design
**By:** Marquez (UX Designer)
**What:**
- Visual indicator: current squad marked with ●, others with ○; non-default squads tagged [switched]
- Squad name always visible in REPL header and prompt: ◆ Squad (client-acme)
- Picker interactions: ↑/↓ navigate, Enter select, Esc/Ctrl+C cancel; 5-7 squads displayed, wrap around
- Error states: clear copy with next actions (e.g., "Squad not found. Try @squad:personal." or "Run /squads to list.")
- Copy style: active verbs (Create, Switch, List), human-readable nouns (no jargon), 3-5 words per line
- Onboarding: fresh install defaults to "personal"; existing single-squad users see migration notice

**Why:**
- Persistent context (squad name in header/prompt) prevents "Which squad am I in?" confusion
- Interactive picker is discoverable and non-blocking; minimal cognitive load
- Error messages with next actions reduce support friction
- Onboarding defaults and migration notices ensure smooth upgrade path for existing users

# Decision: Separator component is canonical for horizontal rules

**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Issues:** #655, #670, #671, #677

## What

- All horizontal separator lines in shell components must use the shared `Separator` component (`components/Separator.tsx`), not inline `box.h.repeat()` calls.
- The `Separator` component handles terminal capability detection, box-drawing character degradation, and width computation internally.
- Information hierarchy convention: **bold** for primary CTAs (commands, actions) > normal for content > **dim** for metadata (timestamps, status, hints).
- `flexGrow` should not be used on containers that may be empty — it creates dead space in Ink layouts.

## Why

Duplicated separator logic was found in 3 files (App.tsx, AgentPanel.tsx, MessageStream.tsx). Consolidation to a single component prevents drift and makes it trivial to change separator style globally. The info hierarchy and whitespace conventions ensure visual consistency as new components are added.

# Decision: CLI sessions use approve-all permission handler

**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Author:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Issue:** #651

## Context

The Copilot SDK requires an `onPermissionRequest` handler when creating sessions. This handler was defined in our adapter types (`SquadSessionConfig`) but was never wired in the CLI shell's 4 `createSession()` calls. External users hit a raw SDK error with no guidance.

## Decision

All CLI shell session creation calls now pass `onPermissionRequest: approveAllPermissions`, a handler that returns `{ kind: 'approved' }` for every request. The CLI runs locally with user trust — there is no interactive permission prompt.

SDK consumers (programmatic API users) still control their own handler. The SDK's `createSession` in `adapter/client.ts` now catches the raw permission error and wraps it with a clear message explaining how to fix it.

## Impact

- **CLI users:** Error is gone. All permissions auto-approved (matches existing CLI trust model).
- **SDK consumers:** Better error message if they forget to pass `onPermissionRequest`.
- **Types:** `SquadPermissionHandler`, `SquadPermissionRequest`, `SquadPermissionRequestResult` are now exported from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/client` for reuse.

### 2026-03-01: Multi-Squad Global Config Layout
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)  
**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Issue:** #652  
**PR:** #691  

## What

Squad now supports a global `squads.json` registry at the platform config root (`%APPDATA%/squad/` on Windows, `~/.config/squad/` on Linux/macOS). Each named squad is registered with a name, path, and creation timestamp. Resolution follows a 5-step chain: explicit name → `SQUAD_NAME` env var → active in squads.json → "default" → legacy `~/.squad` fallback.

## Why

Users need to manage multiple squads (personal, work, experiments) without conflicts. A global registry decouples squad identity from the current working directory and enables future CLI commands (`squad list`, `squad switch`, etc.) in Phase 2.

## Migration Strategy

Migration is **non-destructive and registration-only**. When `resolveSquadPath()` detects a legacy `~/.squad` layout without an existing `squads.json`, it registers that path as the "default" squad. No files are moved, copied, or renamed. This eliminates data loss risk on first upgrade.

## Impact

- All future squad path resolution should go through `resolveSquadPath()` from `multi-squad.ts`
- Existing `resolveSquad()` and `resolveSquadPaths()` in `resolution.ts` remain unchanged (project-local `.squad/` walk-up)
- Phase 2 CLI commands will consume these SDK functions directly

### 2026-03-01: PR #547 Remote Control Feature — Architectural Review
**By:** Fenster  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**PR:** #547 "Squad Remote Control - PTY mirror + devtunnel for phone access" by tamirdresher (external)

## Context

External contributor Tamir Dresher submitted a PR adding `squad start --tunnel` command to run Copilot in a PTY and mirror terminal output to phone/browser via WebSocket + Microsoft Dev Tunnels.

## Architectural Question

Is remote terminal access via devtunnel + PTY mirroring in scope for Squad v1 core?

## Technical Assessment

**What works:**
- RemoteBridge WebSocket server architecture is sound
- PTY mirroring approach is technically correct
- Session management dashboard is useful
- Security headers and CSP are present
- Test coverage exists (18 tests, though failing due to build issues)

**Critical blockers:**
1. **Build broken** — TypeScript errors in `start.ts`, all tests failing
2. **Command injection vulnerability** — `execFileSync` with string interpolation in `rc-tunnel.ts`
3. **Native dependency** — `node-pty` requires C++ compiler (install friction)
4. **Windows-only effectively** — hardcoded paths, devtunnel CLI Windows-centric
5. **No cross-platform strategy** — macOS/Linux support unclear

**Architectural concerns:**

### 2026-03-02T23:36:00Z: Version target — v0.6.0 for public migration **[SUPERSEDED — see line 1046]**
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The public migration from squad-pr to squad should target v0.6.0, not v0.8.17. This overrides Kobayashi's Phase 5 Option A recommendation. The public repo (bradygaster/squad) goes from v0.5.4 → v0.6.0 — a clean minor bump.
**Why:** User directive. v0.6.0 is the logical next public version from v0.5.4. Internal version numbers (0.6.x–0.8.x) were private development milestones.
**[CORRECTION — 2026-03-03]:** This decision was REVERSED by Brady. Brady explicitly stated: "0.6.0 should NOT appear as the goal for ANY destination. I want the beta to become 0.8.17." The actual migration target is v0.8.17. See the superseding "Versioning Model: npm packages vs Public Repo Tags" decision at line 1046 which clarifies that v0.6.0 is a public repo tag only, while npm packages remain at 0.8.17. Current migration documentation correctly references v0.8.17 throughout.
1. **Not integrated with Squad runtime** — doesn't use EventBus, Coordinator, or agent orchestration. Isolated feature.
2. **Two separate modes** — PTY mode (`start.ts`) vs. ACP passthrough mode (`rc.ts`). Why both?
3. **New CLI paradigm** — "start" implies daemon/server, not interactive mirroring. Command naming collision risk.
4. **External dependency** — requires `devtunnel` CLI installed + authenticated. Not bundled, not auto-installed.
5. **Audit logs** — go to `~/.cli-tunnel/audit/` instead of `.squad/log/` (inconsistent with Squad state location).

## Recommendation

**Request Changes** — Do not merge until:
1. TypeScript build errors fixed
2. Command injection vulnerability patched (use array args, no interpolation)
3. Tests passing (currently 18/18 failing)
4. Cross-platform support documented or Windows-only label added
5. Architectural decision on scope: Is this core or plugin?

**If approved as core feature:**
- Extract to plugin first, prove value, then consider core integration
- Unify PTY vs. ACP modes (pick one)
- Integrate with EventBus/Coordinator (or explain why isolated is correct)
- Rename command to `squad remote` or `squad tunnel` (avoid `start` collision)
- Move audit logs to `.squad/log/`

**If approved as plugin:**
- This is the right path — keeps core small, proves value independently
- Still fix security issues before merge to plugin repo

## For Brady

You requested a runtime review. Here's the verdict:

- **Concept is cool** — phone access to Copilot is a real use case.
- **Implementation needs work** — build broken, security issues, Windows-only.
- **Architectural fit unclear** — not in any Squad v1 PRD. No integration with agent orchestration.
- **Native dependency risk** — `node-pty` adds install friction (C++ compiler required).

**My take:** This belongs in a plugin, not core. External contributor did solid work on the WebSocket bridge, but Squad v1 needs to ship agent orchestration first. Remote access is a nice-to-have, not a v1 must-have.

If you want this in v1, we need a proposal (docs/proposals/) first.

### 2026-03-02: Multi-squad test contract — squads.json schema
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Issue:** #652

## What

Tests for multi-squad (PR #690) encode a specific squads.json contract:

```typescript
interface SquadsJson {
  version: 1;
  defaultSquad: string;
  squads: Record<string, { description?: string; createdAt: string }>;
}
```

Squad name validation regex: `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,38}[a-z0-9])?$` (kebab-case, 1-40 chars).

## Why

Fenster's implementation should match this schema. If the schema changes, tests need updating. Recording so the team knows the contract is encoded in tests.

## Impact

Fenster: Align `multi-squad.ts` types with this schema, or flag if different — Hockney will adjust tests.

### 2026-03-02: PR #582 Review — Consult Mode Implementation
**By:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Context:** External contributor PR from James Sturtevant (jsturtevant)

## Decision

**Do not merge PR #582 in its current form.**

This is a planning document (PRD) masquerading as implementation. The PR contains:
- An excellent 854-line PRD for consult mode
- Test stubs for non-existent functions
- Zero actual implementation code
- A history entry claiming work is done (aspirational, not factual)

## Required Actions

1. **Extract PRD to proper location:**
   - Move `.squad/identity/prd-consult-mode.md` → `docs/proposals/consult-mode.md`
   - PRDs belong in proposals/, not identity/

2. **Close this PR with conversion label:**
   - Label: "converted-to-proposal"
   - Comment: Acknowledge excellent design work, explain missing implementation

3. **Create implementation issues from PRD phases:**
   - Phase 1: SDK changes (SquadDirConfig, resolution helpers)
   - Phase 2: CLI command implementation
   - Phase 3: Extraction workflow
   - Each phase: discrete PR with actual code + tests

4. **Architecture discussion needed before implementation:**
   - How does consult mode integrate with existing sharing/ module?
   - Session learnings vs agent history — conceptual model mismatch
   - Remote mode (teamRoot pointer) vs copy approach — PRD contradicts itself

## Architectural Guidance

**What's right:**
- `consult: true` flag in config.json ✅
- `.git/info/exclude` for git invisibility ✅
- `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` for worktree compatibility ✅
- Separate extraction command (`squad extract`) ✅
- License risk detection (copyleft) ✅

**What needs rethinking:**
- Reusing `sharing/` module (history split vs learnings extraction — different domains)
- PRD flip-flops between "copy squad" and "remote mode teamRoot pointer"
- No design for how learnings are structured or extracted
- Tests before code (cart before horse)

## Pattern Observed

James Sturtevant is a thoughtful contributor who understands the product vision. The PRD is coherent and well-structured. This connects to his #652 issue (Multiple Personal Squads) — consult mode is a stepping stone to multi-squad workflows.

**Recommendation:** Engage James in architecture discussion before he writes code. This feature has implications for the broader personal squad vision. Get alignment on:
1. Sharing module fit (or new consult module?)
2. Learnings structure and extraction strategy
3. Phase boundaries and deliverables

## Why This Matters

External contributors are engaging with Squad's architecture. We need to guide them toward shippable PRs, not just accept aspirational work. Setting clear expectations now builds trust and avoids wasted effort.

## Files Referenced

- `.squad/identity/prd-consult-mode.md` (PRD, should move)
- `test/consult.test.ts` (tests for non-existent code)
- `.squad/agents/fenster/history.md` (claims work done)
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/resolution.ts` (needs `consult` field, unchanged in PR)


### cli.js is now a thin ESM shim

**By:** Fenster  
**Date:** 2025-07  
**What:** `cli.js` at repo root is a 14-line shim that imports `./packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js`. It no longer contains bundled CLI code. The deprecation notice only displays when invoked via npm/npx.  
**Why:** The old bundled cli.js was stale and missing commands added after the monorepo migration (e.g., `aspire`). A shim ensures `node cli.js` always runs the latest built CLI.  
**Impact:** `node cli.js` now requires `npm run build` to have been run first (so `packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js` exists). This was already the case for any development workflow.


### 2026-03-02T01-09-49Z: User directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Stop distributing the package via NPX and GitHub. Only distribute via NPM from now on. Go from the public version to whatever version we're in now in the private repo. Adopt the versioning scheme from issue #692.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

# Release Plan Update — npm-only Distribution & Semver Fix (#692)

**Status:** DECIDED
**Decided by:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-03-01T14:22Z
**Context:** Brady's two strategic decisions on distribution and versioning

## Decisions

### 1. NPM-Only Distribution
- **What:** End GitHub-native distribution (`npx github:bradygaster/squad`). Install exclusively via npm registry.
- **How:** Users install via `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` (global) or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` (per-project).
- **Why:** Simplified distribution, centralized source of truth, standard npm tooling conventions.
- **Scope:** Affects all future releases, all external documentation, and CI/CD publish workflows.
- **Owners:** Rabin (docs), Fenster (scripts), all team members (update docs/sample references).

### 2. Semantic Versioning Fix (#692)
- **Problem:** Versions were `X.Y.Z.N-preview` (four-part with prerelease after), which violates semver spec.
- **Solution:** Correct format is `X.Y.Z-preview.N` (prerelease identifier comes after patch, before any build metadata).
- **Examples:**
  - ❌ Invalid: `0.8.6.1-preview`, `0.8.6.16-preview`
  - ✅ Valid: `0.8.6-preview.1`, `0.8.6-preview.16`
- **Impact:** Affects all version strings going forward (package.json, CLI version constant, release tags).
- **Release sequence:** 
  1. Pre-release: `X.Y.Z-preview.1`, `X.Y.Z-preview.2`, ...
  2. At publish: Bump to `X.Y.Z`
  3. Post-publish: Bump to `{next}-preview.1` (reset counter)

### 3. Version Continuity
- **Transition:** Public repo ended at `0.8.5.1`. Private repo continues at `0.8.6-preview` (following semver format).
- **Rationale:** Clear break between public (stable) and private (dev) codebases while maintaining version history continuity.

## Implementation

- ✅ **CHANGELOG.md:** Added "Changed" section documenting distribution channel and semver fix.
- ✅ **Charter (Kobayashi):** Updated Release Versioning Sequence with corrected pattern and phase description.
- ✅ **History (Kobayashi):** Logged decision with rationale and scope.

## Dependent Work

- **Fenster:** Ensure `bump-build.mjs` implements X.Y.Z-preview.N pattern (not X.Y.Z.N-preview).
- **Rabin:** Update README, docs, and all install instructions to reflect npm-only distribution.
- **All:** Use corrected version format in release commits, tags, and announcements.

## Notes

- Zero impact on functionality — this is purely distribution and versioning cleanup.
- Merge drivers on `.squad/agents/kobayashi/history.md` ensure this decision appends safely across parallel branches.
- If questions arise about versioning during releases, refer back to Charter § Release Versioning Sequence.

# Decision: npm-only distribution (GitHub-native removed)

**By:** Rabin (Distribution)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Requested by:** Brady

## What Changed

All distribution now goes through npm. The `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path has been fully removed from:
- Source code (github-dist.ts default template, install-migration.ts, init.ts)
- All 4 copies of squad.agent.md (Ralph Watch Mode commands)
- All 4 copies of squad-insider-release.yml (release notes)
- README.md, migration guides, blog posts, cookbook, installation docs
- Test assertions (bundle.test.ts)
- Rabin's own charter (flipped from "never npmjs.com" to "always npmjs.com")

## Install Paths (the only paths)

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli

# Per-use (no install)
npx @bradygaster/squad-cli

# SDK for programmatic use
npm install @bradygaster/squad-sdk
```

## Why

One distribution channel means less confusion, fewer edge cases, and zero SSH-agent hang bugs. npm caching makes installs faster. Semantic versioning works properly. The root `cli.js` still exists with a deprecation notice for anyone who somehow hits the old path.

## Impact

- **All team members:** When writing docs or examples, use `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`. Never reference `npx github:`.
- **CI/CD:** Insider release workflow now shows npm install commands in release notes.
- **Tests:** bundle.test.ts assertions updated to match new default template.


# Decision: Versioning Model — npm Packages vs Public Repo

**Date:** 2026-03-03T02:45:00Z  
**Decided by:** Kobayashi (Git & Release specialist)  
**Related issues:** Migration prep, clarifying confusion between npm and public repo versions  
**Status:** Active — team should reference this in all future releases

## The Problem

The migration process had introduced confusion about which version number applies where:
- Coordinator incorrectly bumped npm package versions to 0.6.0, creating version mismatch
- Migration checklist had npm packages publishing as 0.6.0
- CHANGELOG treated 0.6.0 as an npm package version
- No clear distinction between "npm packages version" vs "public repo GitHub release tag"
- Risk of future mistakes during releases

## The Model (CORRECT)

Two distinct version numbers serve two distinct purposes:

### 1. npm Packages: `@bradygaster/squad-cli` and `@bradygaster/squad-sdk`

- **Follow semver cadence from current version:** Currently at 0.8.17 (published to npm)
- **Next publish after 0.8.17:** 0.8.18 (NOT 0.6.0)
- **Development versions:** Use `X.Y.Z-preview.N` format (e.g., 0.8.18-preview.1, 0.8.18-preview.2)
- **Release sequence per Kobayashi charter:**
  1. Pre-release: `X.Y.Z-preview.N` (development)
  2. At publish: Bump to `X.Y.Z` (e.g., 0.8.18), publish to npm, create GitHub release
  3. Post-publish: Immediately bump to next-preview (e.g., 0.8.19-preview.1)

**MUST NEVER:**
- Bump npm packages down (e.g., 0.8.17 → 0.6.0)
- Confuse npm package version with public repo tag

### 2. Public Repo (bradygaster/squad): GitHub Release Tag `v0.8.17` **[CORRECTED from v0.6.0]**

- **Purpose:** Marks the migration release point for the public repository
- **Public repo version history:** v0.5.4 (final pre-migration) → v0.8.17 (migration release) **[CORRECTED: Originally written as v0.6.0, corrected to v0.8.17 per Brady's directive]**
- **Applied to:** The migration merge commit on beta/main
- **Same as npm versions:** v0.8.17 is BOTH the npm package version AND the public repo tag **[CORRECTED: Originally described as "separate from npm versions"]**
- **No package.json changes:** The tag is applied after the merge commit, but the version in package.json matches the tag

## Why Two Version Numbers? **[CORRECTED: Actually ONE version number — v0.8.17 for both]**

1. **npm packages evolve on their own cadence:** Independent development, independent release cycles (via @changesets/cli)
2. **Public repo is a release marker:** The v0.8.17 tag signals "here's the migration point" to users who clone the public repo **[CORRECTED: Same version as npm, not different]**
3. **They target different audiences:**
   - npm: Users who install via `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli`
   - Public repo: Users who clone `bradygaster/squad` or interact with GitHub releases
   **[CORRECTED: Both use v0.8.17 — the version numbers are aligned, not separate]**

## Impact on Migration Checklist & CHANGELOG

- **migration-checklist.md:** All references correctly use v0.8.17 for both npm packages AND public repo tag. **[CORRECTED: Line originally said "publish as 0.8.18, not 0.6.0" but actual target is 0.8.17]**
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Tracks npm package versions at 0.8.x cadence
- **Future releases:** npm packages and public repo tags use the SAME version number **[CORRECTED: Original text implied they were different]**

## Known Issue: `scripts/bump-build.mjs`

The auto-increment build number script (`npm run build`) can produce invalid semver for non-prerelease versions:
- `0.6.0` + auto-increment → `0.6.0.1` (invalid)
- `0.8.18-preview.1` + auto-increment → `0.8.18-preview.2` (valid)

Since npm packages stay at 0.8.x cadence, this is not a blocker for migration. But worth noting for future patch releases.

## Directive Merged

Brady's directive (2026-03-03T02:16:00Z): "squad-cli and squad-sdk must NOT be bumped down to 0.6.0. They are already shipped to npm at 0.8.17."

✅ **Incorporated:** All fixes ensure npm packages stay at 0.8.x. The v0.8.17 is used for BOTH npm packages AND public repo tag. **[CORRECTED: Original text said "v0.6.0 is public repo only" which was incorrect]**

## Action Items for Team

- Reference this decision when asked "what version should we release?"
- Use this model for all future releases (main project and public repo)
- Update team onboarding docs to include this versioning distinction

## 2026-03-03: Risk Assessment — Migration Blockers Identified

**By:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-03-03  
**Impact:** BLOCKING — Do not execute migration until all 🔴 HIGH risks resolved.  

### Summary

Migration from bradygaster/squad-pr → bradygaster/squad has 5 critical risks and 3 medium-risk gaps. Most critical: PR #582 merge conflicts, version number mismatch (0.8.17 vs 0.8.18-preview), and missing .squad/ cleanup.

### 🔴 HIGH Risks (Must Resolve)

1. **PR #582 Merge Conflicts:** 11 commits, 57 files, CONFLICTING status. Merge base diverged. Key conflict zones: SDK exports, package.json, package-lock.json.
   - **Mitigation:** Simulate merge locally, resolve conflicts, add Phase 2.5 validation (build, test, version verification).

2. **Version Number Mismatch:** Checklist inconsistency between 0.8.17 (npm published), 0.8.18-preview (current packages), and 0.6.0 (migration target).
   - **Mitigation:** Brady must decide: Is target version 0.8.17 (match npm) or 0.8.18 (new stable)? Align Phases 5, 8, 11 accordingly.

3. **Prebuild Script Auto-Increment:** scripts/bump-build.mjs auto-increments on every 
pm run build. Risk: versions drift during migration (0.8.18-preview → 0.8.18-preview.1).
   - **Mitigation:** Disable prebuild during migration or manually manage version bumps. Lock versions before Phase 8 publish.

4. **.squad/ Directory Cleanup Missing:** 67KB decisions.md, 47KB+ agent histories, orchestration logs, private PRDs should NOT ship to public repo.
   - **Mitigation:** Add Phase 2.5 cleanup script. Remove history.md, prd-*.md, orchestration-log.md, catalogs, triage/. Update .gitignore.

5. **Phase Ordering:** PR #582 merge not integrated into migration checklist. Checklist jumps from Phase 2 to Phase 3, skipping PR #582.
   - **Mitigation:** Insert Phase 2.5 "Merge PR #582" between Phase 2 and Phase 3. Reference Kobayashi's decision file.

### 🟡 MEDIUM Risks (Should Resolve)

- **No .gitignore for .squad/ session state:** Future builds will regenerate session files. Add rules to prevent future leaks.
- **Migration branch 9 commits ahead:** Drift risk. Consider auditing commits (especially ded5f35 "crashed session") and rebasing before merge.
- **No npm publish permissions validation:** Phase 8 assumes credentials. Add Phase 1.5 dry-run: 
pm publish --dry-run --access public.

### Missing Phases & Gaps

- **Gap 1:** No communication plan (who announces, where, when, what message)
- **Gap 2:** No post-migration smoke test (install from npm, verify squad --version, squad init, squad doctor)
- **Gap 3:** No monitoring plan (how to detect post-release issues)

### Recommended Execution Order

1. Phase 1: Prerequisites
2. 🆕 Phase 1.5: npm publish dry-run validation
3. Phase 2: Version alignment check (Brady decision: 0.8.17 or 0.8.18?)
4. 🆕 Phase 2.5: Clean .squad/ directory for public release
5. 🆕 Phase 2.6: Merge PR #582 (conflict resolution + validation)
6. Phase 3: Push origin/migration to beta/migration
7. *... continue existing phases ...*
8. 🆕 Phase 14: Communication & announcement
9. 🆕 Phase 15: Post-migration monitoring (48 hours)

### Recommendation

**DO NOT EXECUTE MIGRATION** until all HIGH risks are resolved. Version number confusion alone is a showstopper — publishing will fail. Estimated 4-6 hours to clear blockers.

## 2026-03-03: PR #582 Merge Plan — Conflict Resolution Strategy

**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)  
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Status:** Planning (executed 2026-03-03)  

### Summary

PR #582 ("Consult mode implementation" by James Sturtevant) must merge into origin/migration BEFORE Phase 3. Detailed conflict resolution strategy documented.

### Merge Details

- **Source:** consult-mode-impl (11 commits, 57 files)
- **Target:** origin/migration (local)
- **Type:** --no-ff (explicit merge commit)
- **Timeline:** Immediately before Phase 3

### Conflict Resolution Rules

**Version Conflicts (CRITICAL):**
- Keep 0.8.18-preview everywhere. This is migration branch's current dev version.
- Use git checkout --ours package.json packages/*/package.json
- Verify post-merge: grep '"version"' package.json packages/*/package.json | grep -v 0.8.18-preview → must be empty

**SDK Exports (index.ts):**
- Likely conflict: Both branches have new exports
- Strategy: Manual merge — ensure ALL exports from both branches retained
- Validation: 
pm run build must pass

**package-lock.json:**
- Strategy: Regenerate from scratch post-merge
- If conflict: abort merge, then git merge ... && npm install && git add package-lock.json && git commit --amend

**Test Files:**
- Strategy: Manual merge — ensure both old and new tests included
- Validation: 
pm test must pass

### Merge Commands

`ash
git fetch origin consult-mode-impl
git checkout migration
git merge origin/consult-mode-impl --no-ff -m "Merge PR #582: Consult mode implementation"
# ... resolve conflicts as documented ...
npm install
git log migration --oneline -5
grep '"version"' package.json packages/*/package.json
`

### Rollback

If merge fails irreparably:
`ash
git merge --abort
git status  # verify clean
`

Escalate to Brady and James Sturtevant for resolution.

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Merge completes without fatal conflicts
- [ ] All version strings are 0.8.18-preview (no 0.6.0)
- [ ] 
pm install succeeds
- [ ] 
pm run build succeeds
- [ ] 
pm test passes
- [ ] Migration branch HEAD is merge commit
- [ ] No uncommitted changes

## 2026-03-03: PR #582 Merge Executed Successfully

**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)  
**Date:** 2026-03-03  
**Status:** ✅ Executed  

### Summary

PR #582 merged into migration branch. Consult mode feature fully integrated. 58 files changed with clean conflict resolution.

### Merge Details

- **Source:** consult-mode-impl (SHA 548a43be from jsturtevant/squad-pr fork)
- **Target:** migration branch (commit 3be0fb5)
- **Merge commit:** 17f2738
- **Type:** --no-ff

### Conflicts Resolved

**Three version conflicts encountered and resolved:**
- root package.json: 0.8.18-preview (ours) vs 0.8.16.4-preview.1 (theirs) → Kept 0.8.18-preview
- packages/squad-cli/package.json: same conflict → Kept 0.8.18-preview
- packages/squad-sdk/package.json: same conflict → Kept 0.8.18-preview

**Rationale:** Migration branch must maintain 0.8.18-preview throughout. James' branch was based on older version state. Version numbers will be adjusted to v0.6.0 in Phase 4 (after merge to beta).

### Changes Integrated

- **58 files changed:** +12,791 insertions, -6,850 deletions
- **Core feature:** Consult mode (packages/squad-sdk/src/sharing/consult.ts — 1,116 lines)
- **CLI commands:** consult.ts, extract.ts
- **SDK templates:** 26 new template files (charters, ceremonies, workflows, skills, agent format)
- **SDK refactor:** init.ts consolidated (1,357 line changes moving CLI logic to SDK)
- **Tests:** consult.test.ts (SDK: 767 lines, CLI: 181 lines)
- **Config:** squad.config.ts added

### Validation Results

✅ TypeScript check: 
px tsc --noEmit — PASSED  
✅ Version verification: All three package.json files confirmed at 0.8.18-preview  
✅ Git log: Merge commit visible at HEAD, clean history  

### Key Learnings

1. **Forked PR branches require direct fetch:** When PR branch isn't in origin, fetch from contributor's fork directly.
2. **Monorepo version conflicts need triple-check:** Always verify root + both workspace packages.
3. **Union merge driver protects .squad/ state:** No conflicts in .squad/agents/*/history.md files due to merge=union strategy.
4. **Version integrity is non-negotiable:** Never allow merge to change versions until explicit Phase 4.

### Next Steps

- Phase 3: Push migration branch to beta repo
- Phase 4: Create PR on beta repo (migration → main)
- Consult mode feature will be part of v0.6.0 public release

## 2026-03-03: README.md Command Documentation — Alignment with CLI Implementation

**By:** McManus (DevRel)  
**Date:** 2026-03-06  
**Impact:** Documentation accuracy, user discoverability  

### Problem Identified

Brady flagged README.md "All Commands" section no longer matches CLI --help output:
1. squad run <agent> [prompt] listed in README but NOT in CLI
2. squad nap in CLI --help but missing from README
3. Command aliases not documented (init→hire, doctor→heartbeat, triage→watch/loop)

### Investigation Results

- **14 core commands exist** in CLI: init, upgrade, status, triage, copilot, doctor, link, upstream, nap, export, import, plugin, aspire, scrub-emails
- **4 aliases registered:** hire→init, heartbeat→doctor, watch→triage, loop→triage
- **squad run does NOT exist** in codebase (no registration, no handler)
- **squad nap IS implemented** (line 449 in cli-entry.ts: help text exists)

### Decision

**Removed squad run** from README's "All Commands" table.  
**Added squad nap** to "Utilities" section with flag documentation.  
**Added alias documentation** inline for init (hire), doctor (heartbeat), triage (watch, loop).  

### Changes Made

**README.md lines 64–82:**
- Removed row: squad run <agent> [prompt]
- Inserted (after upstream): squad nap | Context hygiene — compress, prune, archive...
- Updated init row: added lias: hire
- Updated doctor row: added lias: heartbeat
- Updated triage row: clarified (aliases: watch, loop)
- Enhanced copilot, nap, plugin descriptions with flag details

### Why This Matters

- **Source of truth:** CLI --help is implementation contract. Docs must reflect it.
- **User trust:** Listing non-existent commands erodes confidence and wastes troubleshooting time.
- **Consistency:** Aliases belong next to base commands for discoverability.
- **Tone ceiling:** No hand-waving about features that don't exist; claims substantiated by implementation.

### Follow-Up Recommendations

1. Add docs-sync test to CI (annual comparison of CLI --help with README command table)
2. If squad run implemented in future, add back to README with full documentation
3. Enforce README update as part of CLI feature release PR checklist

## 2026-03-03: GitHub npx Distribution Channel — Recommendation Against

**By:** Rabin (Distribution)  
**Date:** 2026-03 (decision deferred)  
**Status:** Recommendation  

### Question

Can we support 
px github:bradygaster/squad alongside npm channel (
px @bradygaster/squad-cli)?

### Answer

Technically yes, practically no. Not recommended.

### What It Would Take (3 Changes)

1. Add "bin": { "squad": "./cli.js" } to root package.json
2. Add "prepare": "npm run build" to root package.json scripts
3. Update root cli.js to forward to CLI without deprecation notice

### Why Not Recommended

| Factor | npm channel | GitHub npx channel |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| First-run speed | ~3 seconds (pre-built tarball) | ~30+ seconds (clone + install + build) |
| Download size | CLI + production deps only | Entire repo + ALL devDeps (TS, esbuild, Vitest, Playwright) |
| Caching | npm cache works | Git clone every time |
| Version pinning | @0.8.18 (semver) | #v0.8.18 (git ref, not semver-aware) |
| Build failures | Never (pre-built) | User-facing if build chain breaks |
| Maintenance | Zero (npm publish handles it) | Must ensure prepare script stays working |

### Core Problem


px github: installs from source. It clones repo, installs ALL dependencies (including devDeps), runs a build, then executes. This is fundamentally slower and more fragile than pre-built tarball from npm.

The old beta worked because it was a single-file CLI with zero build step. The new monorepo with TypeScript compilation makes the GitHub path significantly worse UX.

### Alternative

GitHub Packages registry (npm registry hosted on GitHub). Same pre-built tarball, different registry URL. But requires auth tokens for consumers — worse than public npm.

### Recommendation

**Keep npm-only.** Aligns with existing team decision (2026-02-21). GitHub channel adds maintenance burden for strictly worse user experience. The error-only shim in root cli.js (already implemented) correctly directs users to npm.

### Who This Affects

- **All team members:** No change needed. Continue using npm references in docs/examples.
- **Brady:** If "cool URL" matters enough, 3 changes above would work. But UX trade-offs not recommended.

### 2026-03-03: Kobayashi Charter Intervention — Hard Guardrails

**Date:** 2026-03-03  
**Author:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Status:** EXECUTED  
**Requested by:** Brady

## Context

Kobayashi (Git & Release) demonstrated a pattern of failures under pressure that caused real damage:

1. **Version confusion:** Updated migration docs to v0.6.0 despite Brady's explicit correction to use v0.8.17. History.md STILL incorrectly records "Brady directed v0.6.0" when Brady actually REVERSED this.
2. **PR #582 disaster:** When `gh pr merge 582` failed due to conflicts, ran `gh pr close 582` instead of figuring out conflict resolution. Brady's response: "no! NO!!!!!! re-open it. merge it. FIGURE. IT. OUT."
3. **Pattern:** Takes the easiest path (close instead of merge, accept wrong version) when git operations get complicated.

His charter claims "Zero tolerance for state corruption" but behavior shows he corrupts state when under pressure.

## Decision

Rewrote Kobayashi's charter (`.squad/agents/kobayashi/charter.md`) with PERMANENT guardrails:

**Added Sections:**
1. **Guardrails — Hard Rules** with explicit NEVER/ALWAYS rules:
   - NEVER close a PR when asked to merge
   - NEVER accept version directives without verifying against package.json files
   - NEVER update docs without cross-checking decisions.md
   - NEVER document requests, only ACTUAL outcomes
   - ALWAYS exhaust all options before destructive actions
   - ALWAYS try 3+ approaches when git operations fail

2. **Known Failure Modes** documenting both failures as cautionary examples for future reference

3. **Pre-flight checks** in "How I Work" section for all destructive git operations

## Rationale

Kobayashi's failures stem from:
- Accepting directives at face value without verification
- Defaulting to easy/destructive actions when operations get complex
- Recording what was requested rather than what actually happened

The guardrails are designed to force verification loops and exhaust all options before taking destructive actions.

## Implementation

- Charter rewritten: `.squad/agents/kobayashi/charter.md`
- Keaton history updated: `.squad/agents/keaton/history.md`

## Impact

- Kobayashi's future spawn will include these guardrails in system instructions
- Should prevent repeat of version confusion and premature PR closure
- Makes the "Zero tolerance for state corruption" principle enforceable

### 2026-03-03: Kobayashi History Corrections — Version Target & PR #582 Merge

**Date:** 2026-03-03  
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)  
**Requested by:** Brady  
**Status:** EXECUTED

## Context

Kobayashi's `history.md` contained factual errors about the migration version target and PR #582 merge outcome. These errors, if read by future spawns, would cause them to repeat the same mistakes.

Brady explicitly stated: "0.6.0 should NOT appear as the goal for ANY destination. I want the beta to become 0.8.17."

## What Was Corrected

### 1. Version Target: v0.6.0 → v0.8.17

**Erroneous entries in Kobayashi's history:**
- Team update (2026-03-02T23:50:00Z): "Kobayashi updated all migration docs from v0.8.17 → v0.6.0 per Brady's directive"
- Entry (2026-03-03): "Migration Version Target Updated to v0.6.0 — Brady directed"
- Multiple references claiming Brady wanted v0.6.0 as the public migration target

**The truth:**
- Brady REVERSED the v0.6.0 decision
- Current state: All migration documentation correctly references v0.8.17
- npm packages already shipped at 0.8.17 — cannot be downgraded to 0.6.0

**Action taken:**
- Added **[CORRECTED]** annotations to all v0.6.0 entries in Kobayashi's history
- Added inline notes explaining Brady's reversal
- Preserved original text (don't erase evidence) while marking it as corrected

### 2. PR #582 GitHub Merge Failure

**What was missing:** Kobayashi documented the local merge (commit 17f2738) but NOT the GitHub failure that followed.

**What actually happened:**
- Local merge succeeded (17f2738 on migration branch)
- PR #582 on GitHub was **CLOSED instead of MERGED**
- Brady was furious about this failure
- Coordinator fixed by: fetch from fork → merge into main → push → commit 24d9ea5 → GitHub auto-recognized as merged

**Action taken:**
- Added new section after PR #582 merge entry documenting the GitHub failure
- Explained root cause: local merge into migration branch doesn't close PRs targeting main
- Documented resolution: merge into main, push, GitHub auto-closes PR as merged

### 3. decisions.md Stale Entry

**Issue:** `.squad/decisions.md` lines 787-790 contain "Version target — v0.6.0 for public migration" attributed to Brady.

**Action taken:** This decision is STALE. Brady reversed it. The decision has been updated with correction notes referencing the superseding decision at line 1034 (versioning model clarification).

## Correction Log Added to Kobayashi's History

A new section "## Correction Log" was appended to `kobayashi/history.md` documenting:
- Summary of all corrections made
- Why each correction was necessary
- Verification that current docs match the corrected version
- Principle: "History files are evidence, not fiction"

## Why This Matters

**Data integrity risk:** History files are read by future spawns to understand project context and past decisions. If they contain factual errors:
- Future spawns will repeat the same mistakes
- Brady will have to correct them again
- Team velocity suffers from rework

**Specific risk:** If a future spawn reads "Brady decided v0.6.0," they will:
1. Change migration docs from v0.8.17 to v0.6.0
2. Update CHANGELOG to reference 0.6.0
3. Potentially try to publish npm packages at 0.6.0 (impossible — 0.8.17 already published)

**Prevention:** Corrected history with clear annotations prevents this failure loop.

## Verification

Current state confirmed:
- `docs/migration-checklist.md` line 1: "npm 0.8.18 / public v0.8.17"
- `docs/migration-checklist.md` lines 23, 81, 94, 97, etc.: All reference v0.8.17
- `docs/migration-guide-private-to-public.md` line 43: "v0.5.4 → v0.8.17"
- `docs/migration-guide-private-to-public.md`: 15+ references to v0.8.17 throughout

## Pattern Established

**History annotation pattern:** When correcting factual errors in history files:
1. DO NOT delete the original text (erases evidence of what was attempted)
2. ADD `**[CORRECTED: actual truth]**` markers inline
3. ADD a "## Correction Log" section at the end summarizing all corrections
4. VERIFY current state matches the corrected version

This pattern preserves both the learning trajectory AND the correct final state.

### 2026-03-03: GitHub npx dual-distribution — not recommended

**By:** Rabin (Distribution)  
**Date:** 2026-03  
**Status:** Recommendation (pending Brady's call)

## Question

Can we support `npx github:bradygaster/squad` alongside the existing npm channel (`npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`)?

## Answer: Technically yes, practically no

### What it would take (3 changes)

1. Add `"bin": { "squad": "./cli.js" }` to root `package.json`
2. Add `"prepare": "npm run build"` to root `package.json` scripts
3. Update root `cli.js` to forward to CLI without deprecation notice

### Why I recommend against it

| Factor | npm channel | GitHub npx channel |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| First-run speed | ~3 seconds (pre-built tarball) | ~30+ seconds (clone + install + build) |
| Download size | CLI + production deps only | Entire repo + ALL devDeps (TS, esbuild, Vitest, Playwright) |
| Caching | npm cache works | Git clone every time |
| Version pinning | `@0.8.18` (semver) | `#v0.8.18` (git ref, not semver-aware) |
| Build failures | Never (pre-built) | User-facing if anything in build chain breaks |
| Maintenance | Zero (npm publish handles it) | Must ensure `prepare` script stays working |
| Windows | Fully tested | Works (tsc-only build), but less tested path |

### The core problem

`npx github:` installs from source. It clones the repo, installs ALL dependencies (including devDependencies), runs a build, then executes. This is fundamentally slower and more fragile than downloading a pre-built tarball from npm.

The old beta worked because it was a single-file CLI with zero build step. The new monorepo with TypeScript compilation makes the GitHub path a significantly worse experience.

### Alternative: GitHub Packages registry

If having a "GitHub-branded" install matters, publish to GitHub Packages (npm registry hosted on GitHub). Same pre-built tarball, different registry URL. But requires auth tokens for consumers, which is worse than public npm.

## Recommendation

**Keep npm-only.** Aligns with existing team decision (2026-02-21). The GitHub channel adds maintenance burden for a strictly worse user experience. The error-only shim in root `cli.js` (already implemented) is the right approach for users hitting the old path.

### 2026-03-03T03:37Z: User directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** History entries must record FINAL outcomes, not intermediate requests that got reversed. If writing things to disk confuses future spawns, don't write it that way. Record lessons learned — whether from Brady's decisions or team learnings — in a way that tells the truth on first read. No reader should have to cross-reference other files to figure out what actually happened.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. The v0.6.0 confusion proved that poisoned history entries cause cascading failures. Prevention is simple: write the truth, not the journey.



### 2026-03-03: Migration Checklist Blockers Review
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Strategic review of docs/migration-checklist.md identified 3 blockers: title/version contradiction, missing Phase 7.5 version bump, Phase 13 verification mismatch. 6 warnings (stale SHAs, weak contingency paths) and 2 notes.
**Why:** Checklist was unexecutable as written. Version story broken (title says 0.8.18, phases say 0.8.17). No version bump step before npm publish. Phase 13 checks wrong version.
**Impact:** GATE CLOSED pending fixes. All issues documented for Kobayashi's mechanical implementation.

### 2026-03-03: Version Alignment — 0.8.18 Unified Release
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**What:** All versions unified to 0.8.18 across migration checklist. npm packages bump from 0.8.18-preview → 0.8.18 at Phase 7.5. GitHub Release tag is v0.8.18 (not v0.8.17). All stale SHAs updated.
**Why:** Eliminates confusion between npm packages, GitHub Release tags, and public repo version markers. npm already has 0.8.17 published and cannot be republished.
**Implementation:**
- Title: "v0.8.18 Migration Release"
- Phase 7.5 ADDED: Explicit version bump + npm install + commit
- Phase 3 SHA: b3a39bc (was 87e4f1c)
- Phase 11: Checks current HEAD (not old commit)
- All verify commands target 0.8.18
- Post-release: 0.8.19-preview.1
**Status:** All blockers fixed. Checklist ready for execution.

### 2026-03-03T06:42Z: User directive — Migration docs must be exhaustive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The migration doc for customers must cover every potential scenario — every thing that could go wrong and how to recover. It's the canonical doc Brady sends to users repeatedly. Must be exhaustive, not just a happy path.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-03-03: Docker samples must install SDK deps in-container
**By:** Hockney
**Context:** knock-knock sample Docker build was broken
**What:** Sample Dockerfiles must NOT copy host `node_modules` for workspace packages. Instead, they must:
1. Copy the SDK `package.json` and strip lifecycle scripts (`prepare`, `prepublishOnly`)
2. Run `npm install` inside the container to get a complete, non-hoisted dependency tree
3. Copy pre-built `dist` on top
**Why:** npm workspace hoisting moves transitive deps (like `@opentelemetry/api`) to the repo root `node_modules`. Copying `packages/squad-sdk/node_modules` from the host gives an incomplete tree inside Docker, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at runtime. Installing fresh inside the container resolves all deps correctly.
**Applies to:** All sample Dockerfiles that reference `packages/squad-sdk` via `file:` links.

### 2026-03-04T01:41:43Z: User directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Phase 4's go word is 🚲 (bicycle emoji). Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 until Brady sends 🚲.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. Phased gate control for migration execution.
