  Squad Status

    Here:  repo (in .squad/)
    Path:  /Users/you/project/.squad

    Repo squad:   /Users/you/project/.squad
    Global:       /Users/you/.squad
```

---

### 5. `squad triage` / `squad watch`
**What it does:**
- Ralph's work monitor — polls GitHub issues
- Auto-triages issues to team members based on content/labels
- Adds `squad:AgentName` labels to issues
- `--interval <minutes>`: polling frequency (default: 10 min)

**Missing --help:** No dedicated handler. Included in main help.

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad triage — Auto-Triage Issues

USAGE
  squad triage [--interval <minutes>]
  squad watch [--interval <minutes>]    (alias)

DESCRIPTION
  Ralph's work monitor. Continuously polls GitHub issues and automatically
  assigns them to the right team member based on content and expertise.

OPTIONS
  --interval <minutes>    Polling frequency (default: 10)

EXAMPLES
  # Start triage with default 10-minute interval
  squad triage

  # Poll every 5 minutes
  squad triage --interval 5

  # One-shot triage (use interval 0 or Ctrl+C after first run)
  squad triage --interval 1

HOW IT WORKS
  1. Fetches open issues from GitHub (requires 'gh auth login')
  2. Analyzes issue title and body
  3. Matches to team member expertise (from team.md)
  4. Adds 'squad:AgentName' label
  5. Agent picks up work on next shell invocation
```

---

### 6. `squad copilot`

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad copilot — Manage Copilot Coding Agent

USAGE
  squad copilot [--off] [--auto-assign]

DESCRIPTION
  Add or remove the GitHub Copilot coding agent (@copilot) from your team.
  When enabled, @copilot can pick up issues labeled 'squad:copilot'.

OPTIONS
  --off            Remove @copilot from the team
  --auto-assign    Enable automatic issue assignment for @copilot

EXAMPLES
  # Add @copilot to the team
  squad copilot

  # Add @copilot with auto-assignment enabled
  squad copilot --auto-assign

  # Remove @copilot from the team
  squad copilot --off

NOTES
  - @copilot is a special agent that runs in GitHub Copilot CLI context
  - When auto-assign is enabled, Ralph assigns issues to @copilot automatically
  - @copilot picks up work labeled 'squad:copilot'
```

---

### 7. `squad plugin`
**What it does:**
- Manages plugin marketplaces (registries of Squad extensions)
- Subcommands: `marketplace add|remove|list|browse`

```

---

### 8. `squad export`
**What it does:**
- Exports squad to portable JSON snapshot (squad-export.json)
- Includes casting state, agent charters/history, skills
- `--out <path>`: custom output path

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad export — Export Squad to JSON

USAGE
  squad export [--out <path>]

DESCRIPTION
  Creates a portable JSON snapshot of your entire squad — casting state,
  agent charters, accumulated history, and skills. Use 'squad import'
  to restore or clone to another project.

- `--force`: overwrites existing squad (archives old one first)

**Missing --help:** No dedicated handler. Included in main help.

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad import — Import Squad from JSON

USAGE
  squad import <file> [--force]

DESCRIPTION
  Restores a squad from a JSON export file. Creates .squad/ directory
  and populates it with casting state, agents, skills, and history.

OPTIONS
  --force    Overwrite existing squad (archives old .squad/ first)

EXAMPLES
  # Import into current directory
  squad import squad-export.json

  # Import and overwrite existing squad
  squad import squad-export.json --force

  # Import into personal squad
  squad import squad-export.json --global --force

SAFETY
  - Validates export format before writing anything
  - Archives existing .squad/ as .squad-backup-<timestamp>/ when using --force
  - Fails if .squad/ exists without --force
```

---

### 10. `squad scrub-emails`
**What it does:**
- Removes PII (email addresses) from Squad state files
- Scrubs: team.md, decisions.md, routing.md, ceremonies.md, agent history
- Returns count of files modified

**Missing --help:** No dedicated handler. Included in main help.

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad scrub-emails — Remove Email Addresses

  # Scrub legacy .ai-team directory
  squad scrub-emails

FILES SCRUBBED
  - team.md
  - decisions.md
  - routing.md
  - ceremonies.md
  - agents/*/history.md

PATTERNS REMOVED
  - user@example.com
  - Name (user@example.com)

NOTES
  - Does NOT scrub session logs (too large to parse safely)
  - Does NOT scrub .git history (use BFG Repo-Cleaner for that)
```

---

### 11. `squad doctor`
**What it does:**
- 9-check diagnostic for squad setup validation
- Checks: mode detection, .squad/ existence, team.md, routing.md, agents/, casting/, skills/, config.json
- Always exits 0 (diagnostic tool, not a gate)

**Missing --help:** No dedicated handler. Included in main help.

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad doctor — Validate Squad Setup

USAGE
  squad doctor

DESCRIPTION
  Runs a 9-check diagnostic on your squad setup. Reports health of
  expected files, conventions, and directory structure. Always exits 0
  (this is a diagnostic tool, not a gate).

EXAMPLES
  # Check current squad setup
  squad doctor

CHECKS PERFORMED
  1. Mode detection (local, remote, hub)
  2. .squad/ directory exists
  3. team.md roster file exists and is valid
  4. routing.md rules file exists
  5. agents/ directory exists with at least one agent
  6. casting/ state directory exists
  7. skills/ directory exists
  8. config.json valid (remote mode only)
  9. Linked team root accessible (remote mode only)

OUTPUT CODES
  ✅ PASS    Check succeeded
  ⚠️  WARN    Check passed with warnings
  ❌ FAIL    Check failed
```

---

### 12. `squad link`
**What it does:**
- Links project to remote team root (dual-root mode)
- Writes `.squad/config.json` with `teamRoot` path
- Validates target directory contains `.squad/` or `.ai-team/`

**Missing --help:** No dedicated handler. Included in main help.

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad link — Link to Remote Team

USAGE
  squad link <team-repo-path>

DESCRIPTION
  Links the current project to a remote team root. Enables dual-root mode
  where project-specific state lives in .squad/ and team identity lives
  in a shared location.

EXAMPLES
  # Link to parent directory's team
  squad link ../team-repo

  # Link to absolute path
  squad link /Users/org/shared-squad

  # Link to sibling project
  squad link ../another-project

HOW IT WORKS
  1. Validates target path exists and contains .squad/ or .ai-team/
  2. Computes relative path from project to team root
  3. Writes .squad/config.json with teamRoot reference
  4. Squad now reads team identity from remote, state from local

FILES CREATED
  .squad/config.json    { "version": 1, "teamRoot": "../team-repo" }

USE CASES
  - Monorepo with shared team identity across projects
  - Org-wide squad that multiple repos inherit from
  - Personal squad linked from multiple projects
```

---

### 13. `squad aspire`

- `--docker`: force Docker mode
- `--port <number>`: custom OTLP port (default: 4317)

**Missing --help:** No dedicated handler. Included in main help.

**Missing Examples:** None.

**Draft Help Output:**
```
squad aspire — Launch Aspire Dashboard

USAGE
  squad aspire [--docker] [--port <number>]

DESCRIPTION

  squad aspire

  # Force Docker mode
  squad aspire --docker

  # Use custom OTLP port
  squad aspire --port 5000

DASHBOARD URL
  http://localhost:18888

WHAT YOU'LL SEE
  - Agent spans (session start/end, tool calls)
  - Coordinator routing decisions
  - Session lifecycle and checkpoints
  - Tool execution timings
  - Error traces and retries

REQUIREMENTS
  One of:
    - Docker or Podman installed
    - .NET SDK with Aspire workload ('dotnet workload install aspire')

## Ghost Commands (In Docs, Not Implemented)

### 1. `squad hire` 👻
**Mentioned in:** `docs/reference/cli.md`, `packages/squad-cli/README.md`  
**Status:** Not implemented in cli-entry.ts  
**Expected behavior:** Team creation wizard or add specific agent  
**Flags:** `--name <name>`, `--role <role>`

**Why it's a ghost:** Docs describe it, but no routing exists in CLI code. May be planned future feature or stale docs.

---

### 2. `squad heartbeat` 👻
**Mentioned in:** `docs/scenarios/ci-cd-integration.md`, `docs/reference/cli.md`  
**Status:** Not implemented in cli-entry.ts  
**Expected behavior:** Run Ralph's triage cycle manually (one-shot)  
**Flags:** `--dry-run`

**Why it's a ghost:** Docs show CI examples using it. Likely intended as sync wrapper around `squad watch` (which polls continuously).

---

### 3. `squad loop` 👻
**Mentioned in:** `docs/reference/cli.md`, `packages/squad-cli/README.md`  
**Status:** Not implemented in cli-entry.ts  
**Expected behavior:** Continuous work loop (Ralph mode)  
**Flags:** `--filter <label>`, `--interval <seconds>`

**Why it's a ghost:** Described as continuous work loop. May overlap with `squad watch` functionality.

---

### 4. `squad shell` 👻
**Mentioned in:** `docs/reference/cli.md`  
**Status:** Not implemented as explicit command  
**Why it's a ghost:** `squad` (no args) already launches shell. Explicit `squad shell` may have been planned for clarity but isn't wired.

---

### 5. `squad run` 👻
**Mentioned in:** `docs/scenarios/aspire-dashboard.md`  
**Status:** Not implemented in cli-entry.ts  
**Expected behavior:** Run a prompt directly without entering shell  
**Usage:** `squad run "your prompt here"`

**Why it's a ghost:** Docs show one-shot prompt execution. Not wired in CLI routing.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Ghost Commands
**Priority:** High  
**Impact:** Docs promise features that don't exist — confusing for users

**Action items:**
- **Option A (Implement):** Wire `hire`, `heartbeat`, `loop`, `run` into cli-entry.ts
- **Option B (Document):** Mark as "Planned" in docs or remove entirely
- **Option C (Alias):** Map `squad shell` → `squad` (no-op alias), `squad heartbeat` → `squad triage --once`

---

### 2. Unhide Orphaned Command
**Priority:** Medium  
**Impact:** `squad upstream` is implemented but invisible to users

**Action items:**
- Add `squad upstream` to main help text (lines 92-93 in cli-entry.ts)
- Add to README.md command table
- Document in docs/reference/cli.md

---

### 3. Add Dedicated --help Handlers
**Priority:** Low  
**Impact:** All commands show main help instead of command-specific help

**Action items:**
- Detect `squad <cmd> --help` and show command-specific help
- Example: `squad export --help` → dedicated export help, not generic help

**Code location:** cli-entry.ts around line 70 (help handler)

---

### 4. Add Examples to Help Output
**Priority:** Low  
**Impact:** Users have to guess command syntax

**Action items:**
- Add EXAMPLES section to each command's help output
- Follow pattern: basic usage, common flags, edge cases
- See draft help outputs above for examples

---

## Files to Update

### Priority 1: Fix Ghosts
1. **cli-entry.ts** — Add routing for `hire`, `heartbeat`, `loop`, `run` OR remove from docs
2. **README.md** — Remove ghost commands or mark as "Coming Soon"
3. **docs/reference/cli.md** — Align command table with implemented commands

### Priority 2: Unhide Orphan
1. **cli-entry.ts** — Add `upstream` to main help text
2. **README.md** — Add `upstream` to command table
3. **docs/reference/cli.md** — Document `upstream` command

### Priority 3: Improve Help
1. **cli-entry.ts** — Add dedicated --help handlers per command
2. **packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/*.ts** — Add help text to each command module

---

## Next Steps for McManus (Docs)

1. **Reconcile ghost commands** — decide keep/remove/implement
2. **Document `upstream` command** — currently hidden gem
3. **Add command reference page** — detailed help for each command
4. **Create examples page** — cookbook-style usage patterns
