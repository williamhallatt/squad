📌 Team update (2026-03-07T17:35:45Z): Issue #250 — squad migrate command complete. Three bidirectional paths: markdown ↔ SDK-First, legacy .ai-team/ upgrade, interactive mode. Dry-run support. Type-safe parsing (zero any types). Round-trip fidelity verified. Complements #249 init. — decided by Edie

📌 Team update (2026-03-07T05:56:56Z): Issue triage complete — #223 (model config reliability, P0 blocker) prioritized over #205 (charter-based model spec feature). Fix #223 first; #205 becomes feature built on top of reliable config layer. — decided by Keaton
# Project Context

📌 Team update (2026-03-05T21:37:09Z): Phase 1 SDK-First fan-out complete — decided by Keaton
Phase 1 SDK-First Phase 1 shipping in v0.8.21. Keaton scoped, Edie built builders, Fenster built CLI command, Hockney wrote tests (60 all passing), Kujan cleared OTel for Phase 3, Verbal updated coordinator. Decisions merged, inbox cleared, orchestration logs written.

📌 Team update (2026-02-23T07:24Z): Docs overhaul directive and publication pause — decided by Brady
Brady has issued consolidated directive on docs redesign: trim scope, adopt lighthearted voice (match original Squad beta tone), prioritize first-experience over tech depth, consolidate references, and pause all live publication until explicit go-ahead. All docs should be brief, prompt-first, action-oriented, and human-toned. This replaces stuffy enterprise-style documentation.


- **Owner:** Brady
- **Project:** squad-sdk — the programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot (v1 replatform)
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict mode, ESM-only), Node.js ≥20, @github/copilot-sdk, Vitest, esbuild
- **Created:** 2026-02-21

## Learnings

### From Beta (carried forward)
- Strict mode non-negotiable: strict: true, noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true, no @ts-ignore
- Declaration files are public API — treat .d.ts as contracts
- Generics over unions for recurring patterns
- ESM-only: no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards
- Build pipeline: esbuild for bundling, tsc for type checking
- Public API: src/index.ts exports everything — this is the contract surface

### SDK npm swap (M0 blocker)
- Swapped `@github/copilot-sdk` from `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` (v0.1.8) to npm `^0.1.25`
- Kept in `optionalDependencies` to preserve zero-dependency CLI scaffolding path
- Build clean, 1592/1592 tests passed — no code changes needed, only package.json + lockfile
- PR #271, branch `squad/190-sdk-npm-dependency`, closes #190, #193, #194

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-21T21:23Z): SDK dependency can be swapped from file: to npm reference — decided by Kujan
The `file:../copilot-sdk/nodejs` reference can be upgraded to `"@github/copilot-sdk": "^0.1.25"` (already published on npm with SLSA attestations). This is a one-line change; build and all 1592 tests verified to pass. This unblocks npm publish and removes CI sibling-directory dependency.

### M1 Monorepo scaffold (#197, #198, #200)
- Added `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` to root package.json
- Created `packages/squad-sdk/package.json` — `@bradygaster/squad-sdk`, ESM-only, exports map with types-first condition, `@github/copilot-sdk` as real dependency (not optional — SDK owns this dep now)
- Created `packages/squad-cli/package.json` — `@bradygaster/squad-cli`, bin entry, workspace dep on SDK
- npm uses version-string workspace references (current: `"0.8.18-preview"`) not `workspace:*` protocol (that's pnpm/Yarn) [CORRECTED: was `"0.6.0-alpha.0"`, stale reference to intermediate dev version]
- Build clean, 1592/1592 tests still pass — no source files moved, scaffold only
- PR #274, branch `squad/197-monorepo-scaffold`, closes #197, #198, #200

### CLI entry point split (#187)
- Moved `main()` and all CLI bootstrap code from `src/index.ts` to `src/cli-entry.ts`
- `src/index.ts` is now a pure re-export barrel with zero side effects — safe for library import
- `VERSION` stays exported from `index.ts` (public API); `cli-entry.ts` imports it
- `SquadError` added to barrel exports so library consumers can catch CLI errors
- `cli-entry.ts` imports `VERSION` from `./index.js` — no duplicate constant
- Build clean, 1683/1683 tests pass
- Branch `squad/181-squadui-p0`, closes #187

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T020714Z): CLI entry point split complete
Edie's refactor split src/index.ts into pure barrel (zero side effects) and src/cli-entry.ts (CLI routing + main). SquadUI can now safely import @bradygaster/squad as a library without triggering process.exit() on import. Decision merged to decisions.md. Issue #187 closed. 1683 tests passing. Related: Kujan's process.exit() refactor.

### Subpath exports (#227)
- Added 7 subpath exports to `packages/squad-sdk/package.json`: `.`, `./parsers`, `./types`, `./config`, `./skills`, `./agents`, `./cli`
- Every export uses types-first condition ordering (`"types"` before `"import"`) per Node.js resolution algorithm
- All source barrels verified: `src/parsers.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/config/index.ts`, `src/skills/index.ts`, `src/agents/index.ts`, `src/cli/index.ts`
- All dist artifacts confirmed after build: `.js` + `.d.ts` for each subpath
- Build clean, 1719/1719 tests pass
- Branch `squad/181-squadui-p2`, closes #227

### Build system migration (monorepo tsconfig + package.json)
- Converted root `tsconfig.json` to base config with `"files": []` and project references to both workspace packages
- SDK `tsconfig.json`: extends root, `composite: true`, `declarationMap: true`, `include: ["src/**/*.ts"]` — no JSX
- CLI `tsconfig.json`: extends root, `composite: true`, `jsx: "react-jsx"`, `jsxImportSource: "react"`, includes `*.tsx`, project reference to SDK
- SDK `package.json`: 18 subpath exports (Keaton's plan), `@github/copilot-sdk` as dependency, `@types/node` + `typescript` as devDeps
- CLI `package.json`: `bin.squad` → `./dist/cli-entry.js`, added `ink`, `react` deps, `@types/react`, `esbuild`, `ink-testing-library` devDeps, `templates/` in files array
- Root `package.json`: stripped to workspace orchestrator — `private: true`, no `main`/`types`/`bin`, no runtime deps, only `typescript` + `vitest` in devDeps, build script delegates to `--workspaces`
- `composite: true` required in both packages for TypeScript project references to work — without it, `tsc --build` cannot resolve cross-package references
- Build clean: both `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` and `@bradygaster/squad-cli` compile with zero errors

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T041800Z): Build system migration complete, all 6 config files fixed, zero TypeScript errors — decided by Edie
Edie fixed root tsconfig (base config + project refs), SDK tsconfig (composite + no JSX), CLI tsconfig (composite + jsx), root package.json (workspace orchestrator), SDK package.json (18 subpath exports), CLI package.json (bin entry + UI deps). Composite builds enable TypeScript project references across packages. All dist artifacts (`.js`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map`) emitted correctly. Build ready for Phase 3 (test import migration when root src/ removal blocks).

### Fix workspace:* → npm-compatible wildcard
- Previous commit used `workspace:*` for CLI→SDK dependency — this is pnpm/Yarn syntax, not npm
- npm workspaces reject `workspace:` protocol with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`
- Changed to `"*"` which achieves the same local resolution under npm workspaces
- Verified: `npm install` succeeds, `npm run build` compiles both packages cleanly
- Also verified: prepublishOnly scripts and dynamic VERSION (via createRequire) from previous commit are working correctly

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T08:50:00Z): CharterCompiler reuses parseCharterMarkdown — decided by Edie
CharterCompiler.compile() delegates to existing parseCharterMarkdown() rather than duplicate parsing logic. Single source of truth. AgentSessionManager accepts optional EventBus injection — when present, spawn() emits session.created; when absent, manager works silently. Improves testability.

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T070156Z): npm workspace protocol decision merged, test import migration complete, barrel conventions finalized — decided by Edie, Fenster, Hockney
- **npm workspace protocol (Decision):** Use `"*"` version string for CLI→SDK dependency, not pnpm's `workspace:*`. npm workspaces auto-resolve local packages by name regardless of version specifier.
- **Test import migration (Decision):** 56 test files successfully migrated from `../src/` to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` / `@bradygaster/squad-cli` package paths. 26 SDK subpath exports + 16 CLI subpath exports. All 1727 tests passing. Vitest resolves through compiled `dist/`.
- **Barrel file conventions (Decision):** `src/parsers.ts` and `src/types.ts` created as public API barrels — parsers re-export all functions + types, types exports ONLY types (zero runtime imports). Both follow ESM barrel pattern.
- **All decisions merged to decisions.md.** Status: Production-ready, awaiting Phase 3 SDK session integration for final runtime wiring.

### CharterCompiler + AgentSessionManager implementation (PRD 4)
- `CharterCompiler.compile()` reads charter.md from disk, delegates markdown parsing to existing `parseCharterMarkdown()` from `charter-compiler.ts` — no duplicate parsing logic
- `CharterCompiler.compileAll()` uses `readdir` with `withFileTypes` to enumerate `.squad/agents/*/charter.md`, skips `scribe` and `_alumni/` dirs
- `AgentSessionManager` accepts optional `EventBus` from `../client/event-bus.js` — emits `session.created` and `session.destroyed` lifecycle events
- `spawn()` uses `crypto.randomUUID()` for session IDs, `resume()` throws on unknown agent, `destroy()` emits event before removing from map
- Key file: `packages/squad-sdk/src/agents/index.ts` — barrel re-exports from submodules remain intact, only class stubs replaced
- EventBus event types: `session.created`, `session.destroyed` (from `SquadEventType` union in `client/event-bus.ts`)
- All 1727 tests pass, build clean

### OpenTelemetry dependency wiring (#254)
- Added `@opentelemetry/api` as optional peer dep (`^1.9.0`) with `peerDependenciesMeta` marking it optional — and in devDependencies so tsc can resolve types during build
- Added 8 OTel packages as `optionalDependencies`: `sdk-node`, `sdk-trace-node`, `sdk-trace-base`, `sdk-metrics`, `exporter-trace-otlp-http`, `exporter-metrics-otlp-http`, `resources`, `semantic-conventions`
- Critical version alignment: `sdk-node@0.57.x` depends on the `1.30.x` core line (`sdk-trace-base`, `sdk-trace-node`, `sdk-metrics`, `resources`). Pinning these in optionalDependencies prevents npm from hoisting 2.x to the top level and causing type mismatches between duplicate `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` versions
- Fortier's `src/runtime/otel.ts` (issue #255) was already in place with full TracerProvider/MeterProvider implementation — no stub needed
- Build clean, 1832/1832 pre-existing tests pass (Fortier's 36 OTel tests fail due to no local OTLP collector, pre-existing condition)

### Token usage + session pool metrics wiring (#261, #263)
- Wired `recordTokenUsage(event)` into `StreamingPipeline.processEvent()` — fires after `dispatchUsage()` in the `usage` case, merged import with existing otel-metrics imports
- Wired `recordSessionCreated()`, `recordSessionClosed()`, `recordSessionError()` into `SquadClient.createSession()` and `deleteSession()` — success paths get created/closed, inner catch blocks get error
- Barrel export (`src/index.ts` line 30) and package.json subpath export (`./runtime/otel-metrics`) already present — no changes needed
- Build clean, 1886/1886 tests pass

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T093300Z): OTel Phase 2 complete — session traces, latency metrics, tool enhancements, agent metrics, token usage wiring, metrics tests — decided by Fortier, Fenster, Edie, Hockney
All four agents shipped Phase 2 in parallel: Fortier wired TTFT/duration/throughput metrics. Fenster established tool trace patterns and agent metric wiring conventions. Edie wired token usage and session pool metrics. Hockney created spy-meter test pattern (39 new tests). Total: 1940 tests passing, metrics ready for production telemetry.

### Constants extraction — single source of truth for models, timeouts, roles
- Created `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/constants.ts` with `MODELS`, `TIMEOUTS`, `AGENT_ROLES` (all `as const`)
- Updated 6 consumer files: `model-selector.ts`, `config.ts`, `health.ts`, `init.ts`, `plugin.ts`, `index.ts`
- Discovered drift: config.ts had 3-entry fallback chains vs model-selector's 4-entry chains. Consolidated to the complete 4-entry chains from model-selector (the runtime source of truth)
- Used named exports `{ MODELS, TIMEOUTS, AGENT_ROLES }` in barrel to avoid `AgentRole` name collision with casting module's separate `AgentRole` type
- Spread `[...MODELS.FALLBACK_CHAINS.tier]` pattern converts `readonly` tuples to mutable `string[]` for interface compat — avoids changing public interfaces
- Environment variable overrides (`SQUAD_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `SQUAD_HEALTH_CHECK_MS`, `SQUAD_GIT_CLONE_MS`, `SQUAD_PLUGIN_FETCH_MS`) enable runtime config without code changes
- Build clean, 2138 tests pass (3 failures pre-existing Docker/Aspire infra)

### squad doctor command (#312)
- Created `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/doctor.ts` — typed DoctorCheck interface with `'pass' | 'fail' | 'warn'` status union
- Mode detection: local (default), remote (config.json teamRoot), hub (squad-hub.json)
- 9 checks: .squad/ dir, config.json validity, team root resolution, team.md ## Members, routing.md, agents/ dir (with count), casting/registry.json, decisions.md, absolute path warning
- Registered via lazy `import()` in cli-entry.ts — same pattern as export/aspire/plugin commands
- Added subpath export `./commands/doctor` in CLI package.json (types-first condition)
- Exit code always 0 — doctor is diagnostic, never a gate
- 8 tests: healthy local, empty dir failures, remote mode detection, hub mode, local mode, absolute path warning, missing ## Members, invalid JSON
- Build clean, all 8 doctor tests pass

### ensureSquadPathDual() — dual-root write support (#314)
- Added `ensureSquadPathDual(filePath, projectDir, teamDir)` to `packages/squad-sdk/src/resolution.ts` — validates that a write target is inside either root or the system temp directory
- Added `ensureSquadPathResolved(filePath, paths)` convenience wrapper that takes a `ResolvedSquadPaths` object
- Existing `ensureSquadPath()` unchanged — full backward compatibility
- Both new functions exported from `src/index.ts` barrel
- 13 tests in `test/ensure-squad-path-dual.test.ts`: local mode, remote mode (both roots), rejection, traversal attacks, subdirs, exact roots, temp dir, ResolvedSquadPaths wrapper
- Build clean, 13 new tests + 21 existing resolution tests all pass

### Unsafe cast elimination in adapter layer (#318, #320, #321, #322)
- Replaced `as unknown as SquadSessionMetadata[]` in `listSessions()` with explicit field-mapping — picks `sessionId`, `startTime`, `modifiedTime`, `summary`, `isRemote`, `context` from SDK result
- Applied same field-mapping pattern to `getStatus()`, `getAuthStatus()`, `listModels()` — all now pick only the fields defined in our types instead of passing SDK objects through
- Created `SquadClientEventType`, `SquadClientEvent`, `SquadClientEventHandler` in `adapter/types.ts` — client-level lifecycle events distinct from session-level events
- `SquadClient.on()` now uses generic `<K extends SquadClientEventType>` overload matching the SDK's `SessionLifecycleEventType` — zero `as any` casts
- `SquadClientWithPool.on()` typed with matching overloads, pool event bridge uses typed `Record<string, SquadEventType>` mapping instead of `as any`
- Removed dead `_squadOnMessage` reference in `sendMessage()` — was reading a property never set on any session
- Fixed `(event as any).inputTokens` / `outputTokens` with typed index access via `SquadSessionEvent`'s `[key: string]: unknown` signature
- Added `sendAndWait()`, `abort()`, `getMessages()` as optional methods on `SquadSession` interface and implemented in `CopilotSessionAdapter`
- Verified `resumeSession()` already wraps in `CopilotSessionAdapter` — no fix needed for #320
- Updated test assertions: `listSessions` now checks `.sessionId` not `.id`, `getStatus` checks `.protocolVersion` not `.uptime`, `getAuthStatus` checks `.isAuthenticated`/`.login` not `.authenticated`/`.user`
- 3 new tests for optional adapter methods (`sendAndWait`, `abort`, `getMessages`)
- Build clean, 2219/2219 tests pass, zero `as any` or `as unknown as` remain in adapter layer

### Public readiness assessment (Brady's request)
- **TypeScript strictness:** Root tsconfig.json has `strict: true` enabled, all strict family flags on except `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (missing — medium risk)
- **Type quality:** Found ~26 `any` usages across codebase — most defensible (adapter layer bridging untyped SDK, recursive scrubbing), but coordinator has loose config casting that should be tightened
- **No @ts-ignore:** Zero suppressions found — clean
- **Public API surface:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts` is clean barrel with 43 named exports, zero side effects. All exports have corresponding .d.ts files
- **Declaration files:** 18 subpath exports, all have types-first condition ordering. Declaration maps enabled. Source maps present
- **ESM compliance:** package.json has `"type": "module"`, all exports use `.js` extensions in import paths, no CJS detected in dist/
- **Build output:** Both SDK and CLI compile with zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` clean), dist/ contains .js + .d.ts + .d.ts.map + .js.map for all modules
- **Consumer experience:** Import path `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` resolves to typed barrel, autocomplete will work, 18 subpath exports for tree-shaking
- **Breaking change risk:** Constants module (`MODELS`, `TIMEOUTS`, `AGENT_ROLES`) exported as `as const` tuples — changing these would break consumers. Adapter types are stable
- **Verdict:** 🟡 Ready with caveats — missing `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (array access can return undefined, not type-checked), some loose any casts in coordinator config mapping. For M1 public release, recommend adding `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` and tightening coordinator/routing config types. All other type quality markers are green

### 2026-02-24T17-25-08Z : Team consensus on public readiness
📌 Full team assessment complete. All 7 agents: 🟡 Ready with caveats. Consensus: ship after 3 must-fixes (LICENSE, CI workflow, debug console.logs). No blockers to public source release. See .squad/log/2026-02-24T17-25-08Z-public-readiness-assessment.md and .squad/decisions.md for details.

### History Audit — 2026-03-03
**Audit performed by:** Edie (mirror moment - team-wide history hygiene check)
**Findings:**
- 1 stale version reference corrected: Line 35 M1 Monorepo section recorded intermediate version `"0.6.0-alpha.0"` instead of current final version `"0.8.18-preview"` (target: v0.8.17+ per decisions). This violated history-hygiene SKILL (record final outcomes, not intermediate requests).
- No conflicting entries detected.
- No reversed decisions detected.
- No intermediate states recorded as final (except the above version ref).
- All decisions match .squad/decisions.md consensus.
- Confidence: High. History now reflects ground truth for future spawns.

### Workflow filter type validation — #201 investigation
- Validated PR `williamhallatt/201-investigate-actions-install` for TypeScript correctness
- Change: `FRAMEWORK_WORKFLOWS` array filters workflows to only Squad framework files (4 entries)
- **Type inference:** `const FRAMEWORK_WORKFLOWS = [...]` correctly infers as `string[]`. `Array.prototype.includes(value: string)` accepts `string` from `readdirSync().filter()` with zero issues
- **Build:** `npm run build` passes cleanly with zero errors. All `.d.ts` files emit correctly
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` (noEmit check) passes cleanly
- **Strict mode compliance:** Root tsconfig has `strict: true` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`. The constant is module-scoped (not exported), correctly typed, and `.includes()` has no indexed access concern
- **ESM:** Package uses `"type": "module"`. Constant placement is correct for ESM — no side effects, no hoisting issues
- **Alternative considered:** `as const` would narrow to tuple literals `readonly ['squad-heartbeat.yml', ...]`, making `.includes()` require literal types (not suitable here since `readdirSync()` returns `string[]`)
- **Testability:** Constant is module-scoped, not exported. For testing, prefer integration tests that verify workflow installation behavior rather than unit-testing the constant
- **Verdict:** APPROVED. Type system is correct, build is clean, no `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` violations
📌 Team update (2026-03-05T10-35-50Z): PR #201 workflow filter approved by all reviewers — framework/scaffolding distinction, implementation pattern validated, test coverage noted — decided by Keaton, Fenster, Hockney, Edie

### Builder type surface — SDK-First Squad Mode (#194 Phase 1)
- Created `packages/squad-sdk/src/builders/types.ts` — 8 definition interfaces (`TeamDefinition`, `AgentDefinition`, `RoutingDefinition`, `CeremonyDefinition`, `HooksDefinition`, `CastingDefinition`, `TelemetryDefinition`, `SquadSDKConfig`) plus shared primitives (`AgentRef`, `ScheduleExpression`, `BuilderModelId`, `AgentCapability`)
- Created `packages/squad-sdk/src/builders/index.ts` — 8 builder functions (`defineTeam`, `defineAgent`, `defineRouting`, `defineCeremony`, `defineHooks`, `defineCasting`, `defineTelemetry`, `defineSquad`) with manual runtime validation (no zod — not in dependency tree)
- `assertObject` narrows to `object` not `Record<string, unknown>` — using `Record` would widen typed parameters and lose interface property types under `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- All builder types use `readonly` properties and `readonly` arrays — immutable contracts
- Types re-exported from `src/types.ts` barrel (type-only, zero runtime). `RoutingRule` aliased as `BuilderRoutingRule` to avoid collision with existing `RoutingRule` exports from `runtime/config.ts`
- Functions + types exported from `src/index.ts` barrel. Subpath export `./builders` added to `package.json` (types-first condition)
- Build clean (`tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `npm run build` emits all `.js` + `.d.ts` + `.d.ts.map`), 3512/3554 tests pass (41 failures pre-existing)

### Builder conversion completeness — ensuring round-trip fidelity
- Added `description?: string` to `AgentDefinition` — captures the tagline/blockquote line from charters (e.g. `> Precise, type-obsessed...`). Build generates it as `> {description}` in charter markdown
- Added `description?: string` to `RoutingRule` — captures the "Examples" column from routing.md tables. Build generates it as ` — {description}` suffix on routing entries
- Validation added to `defineAgent` and `defineRouting` for both new fields (optional string assertion)
- Converted root `squad.config.ts` from old `SquadConfig` type to full builder syntax: `defineSquad()` composing `defineTeam()`, 20× `defineAgent()`, `defineRouting()` with 20 rules, `defineCasting()`. This is the real-world proof that a markdown squad converts cleanly to SDK-first config
- Build compiles clean, 36/36 builder tests + 24/24 build-command tests pass

📌 Team update (2026-03-05T22-10-00Z): Builder type verification complete. Added description fields, converted squad.config.ts to defineSquad(). Strict TypeScript enforced. — decided by Edie

### `squad migrate` command (#250)
- Created `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/migrate.ts` — bidirectional markdown ↔ SDK-First conversion
- Type-safe markdown parsing: extracts team, agents, routing rules, casting from `.squad/*.md` files
- Parsing strategy:
  - `team.md`: extract team name from h1, description from blockquote, members from `## Members` table, project context from `## Project Context` section
  - `routing.md`: parse `## Work Type → Agent` table, extract pattern/agent/description from pipe-delimited rows
  - `casting/policy.json`: parse JSON for allowlist universes and capacity
  - Agent charters: parse role from h1 (e.g., `# Edie — TypeScript Engineer`)
- Code generation: `generateSquadConfig()` produces valid TypeScript with builder syntax, proper string escaping, multiline string handling
- `--to sdk`: parses `.squad/` markdown → generates `squad.config.ts` with `defineSquad()` builder syntax
- `--to markdown`: runs `squad build` to regenerate `.squad/` from config, then moves `squad.config.ts` → `squad.config.ts.bak`
- `--from ai-team`: subsumes `upgrade --migrate-directory`, delegates to existing `migrateDirectory()` function
- `--dry-run`: prints full generated config without writing files — complete preview for validation
- Interactive mode (no flags): detects current mode (sdk/markdown/legacy/none), suggests appropriate migration path
- Wired into `cli-entry.ts` after upgrade block (line ~240), added to help text (line ~107)
- All parsing produces typed objects matching builder types (`AgentDefinition`, `TeamDefinition`, `RoutingDefinition`, `CastingDefinition`)
- Round-trip fidelity: `squad migrate --to sdk && squad build` should produce identical `.squad/` output
