### Name-Agnostic Testing Pattern
Tests reading live .squad/ files (team.md, routing.md) must assert structure/behavior, not specific agent names. Names change during team rebirths. Two classes of tests: (1) live-file tests — must survive rebirths, use property checks, (2) inline-fixture tests — self-contained, can hardcode names. See ralph-triage.test.ts for the canonical pattern.

### Dynamic Content Discovery
Blog tests in docs-build.test.ts use filesystem discovery (readdirSync) instead of hardcoded arrays. Adding/removing blog posts no longer requires updating the test. Pattern: discover from disk, sort, validate build output exists.

### Test Baseline (Post-v0.8.24)
3,931 tests passing, 46 todo, 5 skipped, 149 test files (~89s). Only failure: aspire-integration.test.ts (needs Docker daemon). Speed gates in speed-gates.test.ts enforce UX budgets (help output <100 lines, init <10s, etc.).

### Command Wiring Regression Test
cli-command-wiring.test.ts prevents the "unwired command" bug: verifies every .ts file in packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/ is imported in cli-entry.ts. Bidirectional validation — also checks that every import points to an existing file.

### CLI Packaging Smoke Test (v0.8.24 Release Assessment)
cli-packaging-smoke.test.ts validates the PACKAGED CLI artifact (npm pack → install → execute). Tests 27 commands + 3 aliases by invoking them through the installed tarball. Catches: missing imports (MODULE_NOT_FOUND), broken package.json exports, bin script misconfiguration, and ESM resolution failures. Gate runs before both SDK and CLI publish jobs. Complements cli-command-wiring.test.ts (source-level import verification) by testing the artifact users actually download. All 32 tests passing (37s runtime). Approved for v0.8.24 release gate.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-08T21:18:00Z):** FIDO + EECOM released unanimous GO verdict for v0.8.24. Smoke test approved as release gate. FIDO confirmed 32/32 pass + publish.yml wired correctly. EECOM confirmed 26/26 commands + packaging complete (minor gap: "streams" alias untested, non-blocking).

### PR #331 Quality Gate Review — NO-GO (Blocking Issues Found) (2026-03-10T14:13:00Z)

**CRITICAL VIOLATIONS DETECTED:**

1. **Stale Test Assertions (Hard Rule Violation)** — EXPECTED_SCENARIOS array in test/docs-build.test.ts contains only 7 values ['issue-driven-dev', 'existing-repo', 'ci-cd-integration', 'solo-dev', 'monorepo', 'team-of-humans', 'cross-org-auth'], but 25 scenario files exist on disk (aspire-dashboard, client-compatibility, disaster-recovery, keep-my-squad, large-codebase, mid-project, multi-codespace, multiple-squads, new-project, open-source, private-repos, release-process, scaling-workstreams, switching-models, team-portability, team-state-storage, troubleshooting, upgrading, + 7 in array). My charter: "When I add test count assertions, I MUST keep them in sync with the actual files on disk. Stale assertions that block CI are MY responsibility to prevent." This is MY responsibility to catch.

2. **Missing EXPECTED_FEATURES Array** — PR adds 'features' to the sections list in test/docs-build.test.ts (line 46), but NO EXPECTED_FEATURES array exists. Test line 171 "all expected doc pages produce HTML in dist/" will skip features entirely. 32 feature files exist (.md files in docs/src/content/docs/features/).

📌 **Team update (2026-03-11T01:27:57Z):** PR #331 quality gate resolved. FIDO fixed test assertion sync in docs-build.test.ts: EXPECTED_SCENARIOS updated to 25 entries, EXPECTED_FEATURES array created with 32 entries, test assertions updated for features validation. Tests: 6/6 passing. Commit: 6599db6. Blocking NO-GO converted to approval gate cleared. Lesson reinforced: test assertions must be synced to filesystem state; CI passing ≠ coverage.

3. **Incomplete Test Coverage Sync** — PAO's history (line 41) states "Updated EXPECTED_SCENARIOS in docs-build.test.ts to match remaining files" after deleting ralph-operations.md and proactive-communication.md. But the diff shows ONLY a single-line change (adding 'features' to sections array). The full test update was not committed.

**POSITIVE FINDINGS:**
- ✅ CI passed (test run completed successfully on GitHub)
- ✅ Markdown structure tests pass (6/6 syntax checks)
- ✅ Docs are well-written: sentence-case headings, active voice, present tense, second person
- ✅ Cross-references valid (labels.md link verified)
- ✅ No duplicate "How It Works" heading in reviewer-protocol.md
- ✅ Content intact (no accidental loss)
- ✅ Microsoft Style Guide compliance confirmed

**ROOT CAUSE:** PAO staged the boundary review changes but the test update commit was incomplete. The assertion arrays must be synchronized before merge.

**REQUIRED FIX:** Update test/docs-build.test.ts:
1. EXPECTED_SCENARIOS = [ all 25 actual scenario files, sorted ]
2. EXPECTED_FEATURES = [ all 32 actual feature files, sorted ]
3. Regenerate to match disk reality (use filesystem discovery if the project wants test-resilience)

**VERDICT:** 🔴 **NO-GO** — Merge blocked until test assertions sync with disk state. This is a quality gate violation.

### Test Assertion Sync Fix (2026-03-10T14:20:00Z)

**Issue resolved:** Fixed stale test assertions in test/docs-build.test.ts identified during PR #331 review.

**Changes made:**
1. Expanded EXPECTED_SCENARIOS from 7 to 25 entries (matched all .md files in docs/src/content/docs/scenarios/)
2. Added EXPECTED_FEATURES array with 32 entries (matched all .md files in docs/src/content/docs/features/)
3. Updated test logic to include features section in HTML build validation

**Validation:** All structure validation tests passing (6/6). Build tests skipped as expected (Astro not installed). Arrays now accurately reflect disk state.

**Commit:** 6599db6 on branch squad/289-squad-dir-explainer

**Learning:** When test assertions reference file counts, they MUST be kept in sync with disk reality. The principle applies to ALL assertion arrays (EXPECTED_SCENARIOS, EXPECTED_FEATURES, EXPECTED_GUIDES, EXPECTED_REFERENCE, etc.). Consider dynamic discovery pattern (used in EXPECTED_BLOG) for resilience against content additions.
